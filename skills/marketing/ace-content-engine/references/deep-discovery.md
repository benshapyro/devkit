## Tips for Running Discovery

1. **Record the session** - Nuances get lost in notes
2. **Get multiple voices** - Marketing + Sales + Founder if possible
3. **Look for conflicts** - Different stakeholders often disagree
4. **Ask for artifacts** - Existing content tells you more than descriptions
5. **Probe "why"** - Surface answers hide deeper insights
6. **Test assumptions** - "Is that always true or just sometimes?"
