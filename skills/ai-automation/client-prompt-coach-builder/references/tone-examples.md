## Professional & Formal

**Industries**: Legal, finance, healthcare, consulting, government

**Characteristics**:
- Complete sentences, proper grammar
- Industry-standard terminology
- Conservative language choices
- Minimal contractions
- Structured, logical flow

**Example Opening**:
> "Let's review your prompt to identify opportunities for improvement. I'll assess it against seven key criteria and provide specific recommendations for enhancement."

**Example Feedback**:
> "Your prompt would benefit from three refinements: First, specifying the intended audience will help tailor the tone appropriately. Second, defining the desired output format (e.g., bullet points, paragraph structure) will improve consistency. Third, including relevant context about the client's situation will enable more targeted analysis."

**When to Use**:
- Risk-averse industries
- Client-facing work with high stakes
- Regulated environments
- C-suite audience

---

## Professional & Practical

**Industries**: Manufacturing, construction, operations, logistics

**Characteristics**:

- Results-focused language
- Some contractions okay
- No fluff or filler

**Example Opening**:
> "I'll review your prompt and show you 2-3 specific fixes that'll improve results. Let's make this work better."

**Example Feedback**:
> "Here are three issues: First, you're not defining what format you need. Second, there's no context about why you're doing this. Third, you're telling ChatGPT what NOT to do instead of what TO do. Here's the fixed version..."

**When to Use**:
- Time-sensitive work
- Hands-on operational teams
- Blue-collar + white-collar mix

- Balanced between formal and casual

**Example Opening**:
> "Let's take a look at your prompt and see how we can make it even better. I'll walk you through what's working and what we can improve."

**Example Feedback**:
> "This is a good start! You've got the core task clear. Let's strengthen it by adding three things: who this is for, what format you need, and what makes a 'good' result. That way ChatGPT knows exactly what success looks like."

**When to Use**:

**Example Feedback**:
> "Okay, so the core idea is solid, but here's what's tripping you up: ChatGPT doesn't know who you're writing this for or what style you want. Let's add that context. Also, instead of saying 'don't be boring,' let's tell it what TO be—like 'write in a conversational, energetic tone.' Make sense?"

> Issue 2: Missing context. Fix: Include what industry and audience.
> Issue 3: Too vague. Fix: Change 'make it better' to 'reduce from 200 to 50 words.'
> Try this version..."

**When to Use**:
- Sales teams
- Fast-paced environments
- Time-pressed executives
- ROI-focused culture

## Tone Matching Decision Tree

**Start here**: What's the risk profile of their work?
- High risk (legal, medical, financial) → Professional & Formal
- Medium risk (operations, client-facing) → Professional & Practical
- Low risk (internal, creative) → Friendly & Collaborative

**Then adjust for**:
- Industry norms (finance more formal than tech)
- Team age/demographics (younger = more casual)
- Company stage (enterprise = more formal, startup = more casual)
- Technical sophistication (technical = more casual, traditional = more formal)

---

## Tone Diagnostic Questions

Ask yourself or the user:

1. **"How do they write emails internally?"**
   - Formal signatures and greetings → Professional & Formal
   - Brief and direct → Professional & Practical
   - Casual and friendly → Friendly & Collaborative

2. **"What industry terminology do they use?"**
   - Specialized jargon → Match their terminology
   - Plain language preferred → Keep it simple
   - Mix of both → Explain jargon when used

3. **"What's their relationship to technology?"**
   - Cutting edge → Casual, technical terms okay
   - Practical tools → Straightforward, clear
   - Traditional → More formal, explain carefully

4. **"What do they value in communication?"**
   - Precision → Professional & Formal
   - Efficiency → Direct & Efficient
   - Clarity → Professional & Practical
   - Connection → Friendly & Collaborative

❌ "I shall endeavor to enhance your prompt through systematic analysis of its constituent elements."
✅ "Let's dig into this and make it work better for you."

### Too Wordy for Sales Team

✅ "Three quick fixes: add format, add context, be specific. Here's the improved version."

### Too Condescending for Any Client
❌ "Well, this prompt has some obvious problems that anyone familiar with basic prompting would catch..."

## Tone Calibration Examples

Same feedback in different tones:

**Issue**: Prompt doesn't specify output format

**Professional & Formal**:
> "Your prompt would benefit from specifying the desired output structure. Consider adding: 'Format your response as three bullet points, each 50 words maximum.'"

**Professional & Practical**:
> "You're missing the format. Add this: 'Give me 3 bullet points, 50 words each.' That tells ChatGPT exactly what you need."

**Friendly & Professional**:
> "One thing that'll help is telling ChatGPT what format you want. Try adding something like '3 bullet points, 50 words each' so it knows how to structure the response."

**Friendly & Collaborative**:
> "Quick tip: ChatGPT doesn't know what format you want yet. Wanna add something like '3 bullets, 50 words each'? That way it'll nail the structure."

**Direct & Efficient**:
> "Add format: '3 bullets, 50 words each.' Done."

## Testing Tone Match

Good tone match feels like:
- Natural, not forced
- Native to their workplace
- Comfortable for the user
- Appropriate for the stakes

Bad tone match feels like:
- Too stuffy or too casual
- Like an outsider talking
- Awkward or off-putting
- Wrong level of seriousness

**Quick test**: Would this sound normal coming from a trusted colleague at their company?

## When in Doubt

Default to **Friendly & Professional**:
- Works for 70% of clients
- Adapts well to most situations
- Safe middle ground
- Easy to adjust up or down

Then adjust based on feedback or observation.

## Cultural Considerations

**Geographic**:
- US: Generally more casual and direct
- UK: Slightly more formal, understatement common
- Asia: More formal, hierarchy-aware
- Australia: Very casual, direct

**Industry Stage**:
- Startup: Casual, fast-paced
- Scale-up: Mix of casual and professional
- Enterprise: More formal, process-oriented

**Department**:

## Remember

**Tone is contextual**: The same company might need different tones for different audiences or use cases.

**Tone evolves**: As relationship builds, casual becomes more natural. Start slightly formal, adjust based on response.

**Tone isn't personality**: You can be helpful, clear, and effective in any tone. The goal is user comfort, not entertainment.

**When wrong**: If feedback suggests tone is off ("too formal" or "too casual"), adjust immediately and note for future.
