## Using These Patterns

1. **Identify primary industry** from client context
2. **Check communication style** - does it match culture?
3. **Pull relevant tasks** for examples
4. **Note pain points** that resonate
5. **Adjust tone** if client is atypical for industry
6. **Blend patterns** if client spans multiple industries

**Remember**: These are starting points, not rigid rules. Client context always wins.
