## What is the Prompt Engineering Coach?

Think of it like having a writing coach who specializes in getting better results from ChatGPT. Instead of struggling with vague responses or having to re-prompt five times, the Coach helps you write clear instructions that work the first time.

**What it does:**
- Reviews your prompts and shows you exactly what's missing
- Rewrites them to be clearer and more effective
- Asks questions to help you refine further
- Suggests when to turn prompts into Custom GPTs

**What it doesn't do:**
- Do your actual work (it coaches prompts, doesn't [DO_THEIR_WORK])
- Replace ChatGPT (use it to make your ChatGPT prompts better)
- Judge you (everyone's learning this together)

### Use it DURING a task:
- ChatGPT gave you a mediocre response
- You're not sure how to ask for what you need
- You got close but need to tweak your approach

### Use it AFTER a task:

- You're thinking "I'll need this again" (turn it into a Custom GPT)

### Don't use it when:
- You just need ChatGPT to do something simple once
- You're just asking ChatGPT a quick question
- Your prompt is already working great

## Tips for Success

### DO:
- **Be conversational with the Coach** - It's designed to ask questions and iterate
- **Answer the Coach's questions** - That's where the magic happens
- **Test the improved prompt immediately** - See if it works on your real task
- **Save good prompts** - Keep a doc of your best ones
- **Turn repeated prompts into Custom GPTs** - Ask the Coach to help

### DON'T:
- **Rush through it** - Take 5 minutes to get it right, save hours later
- **Ignore the Coach's questions** - They're designed to make your prompt better
- **Be vague in your answers** - The more specific you are, the better the prompt
- **Expect perfection first try** - Prompting is iterative, keep refining
- **Forget to copy the improved prompt** - Save it somewhere!

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

**Mistake 1: Not being specific enough**
- Bad: "I need client updates"
- Good: "I need [specific type of update for specific audience]"

**Mistake 2: Stopping after the first improvement**
- The Coach will ask follow-up questions - answer them! That's when you go from 70% to 95%

**Mistake 3: Not testing the prompt**
- Always test the improved prompt on your real work to see if it needs tweaking

**Mistake 4: Starting over each time**
- Save your good prompts in a doc. Build your personal library.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long should I spend with the Coach?**
A: 5-10 minutes for a new prompt. 2-3 minutes for improvements. It feels like extra time upfront but saves hours on the actual work.

**Q: Can I use the Coach for personal stuff too?**
A: Absolutely. The principles work for any ChatGPT task.

**Q: What if the Coach asks me something I don't know?**
A: Just say "I'm not sure" or "I don't know." The Coach will work with what you give it and suggest what might be missing.

**Q: Should I always answer all the Coach's questions?**
A: You don't have to answer everything, but the more you engage, the better your prompt becomes. Think of it like a conversation with a colleague.

**Q: What if I don't like the improved prompt?**
A: Tell the Coach! Say "This doesn't feel right because..." and it'll adjust. That's the point of the iterative approach.

**Q: Can I just paste my whole task and have the Coach do it?**
A: No, the Coach helps you write better PROMPTS, it doesn't do your actual work. It's like a fishing instructor, not a restaurant.

**Q: When should I turn a prompt into a Custom GPT?**
A: When you'll use it more than 5-10 times. Ask the Coach "Should this be a Custom GPT?" and it'll help you decide.

**Q: How do I know if my prompt is good enough?**
A: Test it. If ChatGPT gives you what you need on the first try, it's good. If you're re-prompting multiple times, go back to the Coach.
