# Activity Clusters Reference

## Overview

Blocks are **compositional** - built from combinations of these 10 activity clusters. Unlike rigid project types, clusters mix freely to match real consulting work.

**Key Principle**: Ask "What are we actually doing?" not "What type of project is this?"

**Example**: "Should we build or buy?" evaluation

### Tool Integration Project
**Clusters**: Discovery (light) + Integration + Testing + Training
**Duration**: 6-12 weeks
**Deliverable**: Working integration with documentation
**Example**: Salesforce ↔ HubSpot sync

### Custom Application Build
**Clusters**: Discovery + Development + Testing + Deployment + Training
**Duration**: 3-6 months
**Deliverable**: Production application
**Example**: Customer portal with custom features

### Workflow Automation
**Clusters**: Discovery + Process Design + Automation + Testing + Training
**Duration**: 4-10 weeks
**Deliverable**: Automated workflows in N8n/Zapier
**Example**: Lead routing and qualification automation

### AI Implementation
**Clusters**: Discovery + AI/LLM + Testing + Deployment + Optimization
**Duration**: 2-5 months
**Deliverable**: Production AI system with monitoring
**Example**: AI-powered customer support chatbot

### Platform Migration
**Clusters**: Discovery + Integration + Custom Development + Testing + Deployment + Training
**Duration**: 4-8 months
**Deliverable**: Fully migrated system
**Example**: Moving from legacy CRM to Salesforce

### Hybrid Strategy → Implementation
**Clusters Phase 1**: Discovery + Process Design (strategy)
**Clusters Phase 2**: Integration + Development + Testing (implementation - separate engagement)
**Duration**: 2-3 months total (but billed as two engagements)
**Example**: Strategy phase recommends custom tool, then separate engagement to build it

## Using Clusters for Estimation

**Step 1**: Identify which clusters apply to the work
**Step 2**: Rate each cluster's complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex)
**Step 3**: Use `estimate_duration.py` to calculate total timeframe
**Step 4**: Validate with `enforce_strategy_boundary.py`

**Example**:
```
Project: Salesforce-HubSpot Integration

Clusters identified:
- Discovery: Simple (1-2 weeks) - 2 stakeholders, clear requirements
- Integration: Medium (4-8 weeks) - Custom API work needed
- Testing: Simple (1-2 weeks) - Standard test cases
- Training: Simple (1-2 weeks) - Basic user training

Total estimate: 7-14 weeks (1.75-3.5 months)
```
