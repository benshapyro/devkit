## Weekly Email Updates

Weekly client update emails keep clients informed of progress, flag issues early, and maintain momentum on engagements.

### Purpose

Primary goals (in order of importance):
1. Keep client informed of tactical progress
2. Flag issues, questions, or decisions needed early
3. Maintain momentum and alignment

### Tools Available

Gather context from available sources:
- **Google Drive**: Recent deliverables, working documents, project plans
- **Calendar**: Meetings held this week, upcoming sessions
- **Email**: Recent client communications, questions raised
- **Slack** (if integrated): Quick updates, discussions with client team

Focus on the past week for "This Week" and the coming week for "Next Week."

### Workflow

1. **Clarify scope**: Confirm which client/project and the week being covered
2. **Gather information**: Use available tools or ask the user for key updates
3. **Draft the email**: Follow the strict formatting below
4. **Review**: Ensure it's conversational, flags any action items clearly, and takes 2-3 minutes to read

### Formatting

Subject line format:
**[Client Name] Weekly Update - [Date Range]**
Example: "Pioneer Sports Weekly Update - Nov 18-24"

Email structure:
```
Hi [Client Contact Name],

Quick update on our progress this week:

**This Week**
[2-4 sentences covering: what was accomplished, any key milestones hit, deliverables created, meetings held, or progress made. Be specific but concise. Include links to significant deliverables if relevant.]

**Next Week**
[2-3 sentences covering: what's planned, what meetings are scheduled, what deliverables are coming, what the focus will be.]

**Action Items**
[Bullet list format]
- **From you:** [Any decisions needed, info required, or tasks for the client]
- **From us:** [Any commitments we're making or follow-ups we're doing]

[If no action items, you can say "No action items this week - we're on track!"]

Let me know if you have any questions!

[Sign-off]
```

### Tone Guidelines

- **Friendly and conversational** - write like you're updating a colleague
- **Professional but not stiff** - avoid overly formal consulting language
- **Direct and clear** - no fluff, get to the point
- **Proactive** - flag issues before they become problems
- **Solutions-oriented** - if mentioning a challenge, mention how you're addressing it

### When to Include Links

Only include links when:
- There's a significant deliverable to review (doc, deck, dashboard)
- You need their feedback on something specific
- There's a demo or prototype ready to explore

Don't include links for:
- Internal working documents
- Routine project tracking
- Things that will be covered in the next meeting

### Examples of Good vs. Bad Updates

**GOOD - This Week:**
"We completed the automation assessment for your rebate processing workflow and identified three high-impact opportunities that could save 15+ hours per week. Had a great discovery session with your ops team on Tuesday where we mapped out the current LED retrofit process end-to-end. Also started building the Apollo prospecting framework - initial data pull is showing 500+ qualified manufacturing facilities in the target regions."

**BAD - This Week:**
"We worked on several deliverables and had some meetings. Made progress on the automation project. Things are moving forward as planned."

**GOOD - Action Items:**
- **From you:** Review the automation assessment deck (linked above) and let us know which opportunities you want to prioritize
- **From us:** Send calendar invite for the roadmap planning session on Friday

**BAD - Action Items:**
- Please review things when you can
- We'll follow up on stuff

### Notes

- If a week is slow (holidays, waiting on client input), acknowledge it briefly but focus on what IS happening or what's coming
- If there are blockers, flag them clearly but always pair with "here's what we need to unblock"
- Celebrate wins - if something significant shipped or a milestone was hit, call it out with energy
- Keep the email focused on this specific project/engagement, don't mix multiple projects unless explicitly asked

---

## Meeting Agendas

Structured agendas for recurring bi-weekly check-in meetings with clients. These meetings maintain regular cadence and alignment throughout an engagement.

### Purpose

- Maintain regular touchpoint and momentum
- Review progress since last meeting
- Discuss key topics and make decisions
- Surface any issues or blockers
- Plan next steps

### Tools Available

Gather context from available sources:
- **Calendar**: Previous meeting notes, action items from last session
- **Google Drive**: Recent deliverables, working documents
- **Email/Slack**: Open questions, topics raised since last meeting
- **Project tracking**: Current sprint/milestone status

### Workflow

1. **Review last meeting**: Pull action items and key decisions from previous check-in
2. **Gather current topics**: What's happened since last meeting? What needs discussion?
3. **Build agenda**: Combine standing items with ad-hoc topics
4. **Add details**: Include specific questions or discussion prompts for each topic
5. **Attach materials**: Link to any docs that need pre-read (only if complex)

### Formatting

Subject line format:
**[Client Name] Check-In Agenda - [Date]**
Example: "Pioneer Sports Check-In Agenda - Nov 25"

Email structure:
```
Hi [Client Contact Names],

Here's the agenda for our check-in on [Day, Date] at [Time]:

**Last Time We...**
[2-3 bullets covering: key decisions made, action items assigned, important discussions. This creates continuity.]
- [Decision or topic from last meeting]
- [Action item status]
- [Any open items we're revisiting]

---

**AGENDA**

**1. [Standing Item Name]** _(e.g., Progress Update, Sprint Review)_
   - [High-level topic or area to cover]
   - [Specific question or discussion point if relevant]

**2. [Standing Item Name]** _(e.g., Roadmap & Priorities)_
   - [High-level topic]
   - [Specific question or discussion point if relevant]

**3. [Ad-hoc Topic Name]** _(e.g., Automation Architecture Review)_
   - [Brief context: why this topic matters now]
   - [Specific question or decision needed]
   - [Any implications or dependencies]

**4. [Ad-hoc Topic Name]**
   - [Context]
   - [Specific questions/decisions]

**5. Next Steps & Action Items**
   - [Always include this as a standing final item]

---

**Pre-Read Materials** _(only include if there's something complex)_
- [Link to document]: [Brief description of what it is and why to review]

**Parking Lot** _(optional - for topics that came up but don't fit this meeting)_
- [Topic to table for later]

See you [Day]!

[Sign-off]
```

### Standing Agenda Items (Typical)

Most bi-weekly check-ins include some version of these recurring items:
1. **Progress Update** - What's been completed since last meeting
2. **Roadmap Review** - What's coming next, any timeline changes
3. **Discussion Topics** - Open questions, decisions needed
4. **Blockers & Risks** - Anything slowing progress
5. **Next Steps** - Action items and ownership

Adapt these based on the specific engagement and client preferences.

### Detail Level Guidelines

**High-level topics:**
- "Review automation roadmap"
- "Discuss team training approach"

**With specific discussion questions:**
- "Review automation roadmap"
  - Which workflows should we prioritize in Phase 2?
  - Do we have the right resources committed for implementation?

- "Discuss team training approach"
  - Should we do hands-on workshops or self-paced modules?
  - Who are the key champions we should train first?

**Mix both approaches**: Use high-level for straightforward updates, add specific questions for topics that need decisions or deeper discussion.

### When to Include Pre-Read

Include pre-read materials when:
- There's a complex technical document to review (architecture, detailed analysis)
- You need thoughtful feedback on a strategic recommendation
- The meeting will be more productive if people come prepared
- You're presenting options and want people to think through them first

Don't include pre-read for:
- Simple status updates
- Documents you'll walk through live in the meeting
- Routine progress reviews

### Tone Guidelines

- **Professional but collaborative** - this is a partnership
- **Organized and clear** - respect people's time with structure
- **Forward-looking** - focus on progress and what's ahead
- **Action-oriented** - every topic should lead somewhere

### Tips for Good Agendas

**DO:**
- Reference specific action items from last meeting and their status
- Include time estimates if certain topics need deep discussion
- Call out decisions that need to be made explicitly
- Use the parking lot for topics that are important but not urgent

**DON'T:**
- Create 20 agenda items - keep it focused (4-7 topics max for a 30-60 min meeting)
- Include vague topics like "general discussion"
- Forget to close with next steps
- Send the agenda day-of without warning

### Customization by Engagement Phase

**Early engagement (first few check-ins):**
- More time on alignment and context-setting
- Deeper dives on strategy and approach
- Building shared understanding

**Mid engagement (steady state):**
- Efficient progress updates
- Focus on execution topics
- Quick decision-making

**Late engagement (wrapping up):**
- Transition planning
- Knowledge transfer
- Final deliverables review

### Example Good vs. Bad Topics

**GOOD:**
"Automation Priority Discussion"
- Should we tackle the rebate workflow or LED retrofit process first?
- What's the appetite for running these in parallel?
- Dependencies: Rebate needs API access (2-week lead time), LED retrofit ready to go

**BAD:**
"Talk about automation stuff"

**GOOD:**
"Training Rollout Plan"
- Reviewed draft curriculum - feedback requested on modules 3-4
- Identify 3-5 power users for pilot cohort
- Lock in training dates for January

**BAD:**
"Discuss training"

### Notes

- Keep meetings efficient - if you can cover it async (via email), do that instead
- The agenda itself becomes a useful artifact - store them in a shared location for reference
- If the same topics keep appearing in the parking lot, they probably need their own dedicated meeting

## Monthly Business Review

Generate professional Monthly Business Review (MBR) presentations using a structured workflow with quality gates and modular slide templates.

### When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Start MBR for [client] [month]"
- "Monthly review for [client]"
- "Create [month] business review"
- "MBR workflow for [client]"
- "[Client] monthly deck"

**This skill is for:**
- Preparing monthly client presentations
- Synthesizing engagement progress, wins, and challenges
- Facilitating strategic decisions with clients
- Documenting action items and next steps

### Workflow Overview

The MBR workflow has **four phases** with explicit approval gates:

```
Phase 1: RESEARCH      -> kb.md (knowledge base)
Phase 2: STRUCTURE     -> outline.md (deck structure)
Phase 3: CONTENT       -> content.md (slide-by-slide content)
Phase 4: GENERATION    -> [client]-[month]-[year]-review.pptx
```

#### Artifact Naming Convention

All artifacts save to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`:
- `{client}-{month}-{year}-kb.md`
- `{client}-{month}-{year}-outline.md`
- `{client}-{month}-{year}-content.md`
- `{client}-{month}-{year}-review.pptx`

**Example:** `ces-january-2026-kb.md`

### Phase 1: Research (kb.md)

**Step 1: Search Project Knowledge**

Search the project knowledge base for all context on Month X:
- Meeting transcripts and intelligence docs
- Status updates and check-ins
- Deliverable documentation
- Previous month's MBR for continuity

**Step 2: Offer Additional Searches**

Present specific, optimal searches for each available data source:

**Gmail:**
- "Search for: `subject:[client] after:[month-start] before:[month-end]`"
- "Search for: `from:[client-contacts] [key-topics]`"

**Fireflies:**
- "Search for meetings with [client] in [date range]"
- "Get transcript for [specific meeting]"

**Google Drive:**
- "Search for: `[client] [month] [deliverable-type]`"

**Step 3: Document Findings**

Create `kb.md` with structured findings:

```markdown
# [Client] [Month] [Year] - Knowledge Base

## Engagement Context
- Current phase: [X] of [Y]
- Key stakeholders: [names/roles]
- Active workstreams: [list]

## This Month's Activity
### Meetings Held
- [Date]: [Meeting type] - [Key topics]

### Deliverables
- [Status]: [Deliverable name]

### Key Wins
1. [Win with specific metric/outcome]

### Challenges Encountered
1. [Challenge] - Root cause: [cause] - Status: [status]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision] - Impact: [impact]

### Open Questions
1. [Question requiring client input]

## Previous Month Reference
[Summary of last month's action items and their status]
```

**Step 4: Clarifying Questions**

Ask clarifying questions using the standard format:
- Explain the question
- Provide viable answers with explanations
- State recommendation

**Loop until `kb.md` is approved.**

### Phase 2: Structure (outline.md)

**Step 5: Generate Outline Options**

Present 2-3 outline options with different emphases:

**Option A: Progress-Heavy**
- Best when: Strong month with many wins to celebrate
- Emphasis: Multiple Progress slides, brief Challenges

**Option B: Decision-Focused**
- Best when: Key decisions needed from client
- Emphasis: Multiple Discussion slides, clear options

**Option C: Balanced**
- Best when: Typical month with mix of progress and challenges
- Emphasis: Even coverage across all sections

**Step 6: Present Template Visually**

Show the user the template PPTX so they can see slide options:
- Present `cadre-mbr-template-full.pptx`
- Point to relevant variations for their content
- Ask "Which fits best?" at decision points

**Step 7: Select Variations**

For each slide type, suggest the appropriate variation based on content:

| Content Situation | Suggested Variation |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 major opportunity | Opps-B (Deep dive) |
| 2-3 opportunities | Opps-A (3-card) |
| 4+ smaller ideas | Opps-C (Menu) |
| Binary decision | Discussion-A (Two-option) |
| Clear recommendation | Discussion-B (Single rec) |
| Exploratory topic | Discussion-C (Open) |

**Loop until `outline.md` is approved.**

### Phase 3: Content (content.md)

**Step 8: Generate Slide Content**

Create `content.md` with exact content for each slide:

```markdown
# Slide 1: Title-A
- Client Name: Contemporary Energy Solutions
- Period: January 2026
- Month: 5 of 7

# Slide 2: ExecSum-A
- Status: ON TRACK
- Win 1: Proposal automation processing 87% of parts
- Win 2: AI training completed for 25 employees
- Win 3: Labor rate calculator in UAT
- Challenge 1: Lead generation - 0.01% response rate
- Challenge 2: Adoption - 70% report zero time savings
- Key Decision: ZoomInfo contract renewal by Dec 17

# Slide 3: Progress-A (Proposal Automation)
[Continue with specific content for each slide...]
```

**Step 9: Content Guidelines**

**Tone:**
- Professional but warm
- Specific with metrics where possible
- Action-oriented language
- Acknowledge challenges honestly

**Length:**
- Titles: 3-6 words
- Bullet points: 1 line each
- Descriptions: 1-2 sentences max
- Cards: 2-4 bullet points

**Metrics:**
- Lead with the number: "87% parts coverage" not "Coverage is at 87%"
- Include comparison: "Up from 60% last month"
- Quantify impact: "Saving 2 hours per proposal"

**Step 10: Clarifying Questions**

Ask about content gaps, emphasis, and accuracy.

**Loop until `content.md` is approved.**

### Phase 4: Generation (PPTX)

**Step 11: Generate Presentation**

Use the html2pptx workflow:
1. Extract html2pptx library
2. Copy template slides
3. Replace placeholder content with content.md values
4. Generate PPTX

**Step 12: Visual Validation**

Convert to images and validate:
- No text cutoff
- Proper alignment
- Consistent spacing
- Readable contrast

**Step 13: Final Review**

Present the deck and ask:
- Any content changes needed?
- Any slide additions/removals?
- Ready to deliver?

**Step 14: Appendix (Optional)**

After generating, ask:
"Would you like me to include appendix slides with alternative variations?"

Only add if explicitly requested.

**Loop until PPTX is approved.**
