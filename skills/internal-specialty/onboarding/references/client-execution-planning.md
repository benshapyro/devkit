# Execution Planning Framework

This framework provides methodologies for creating Month 1 critical paths, defining success metrics, assessing risks, and generating actionable execution plans.

## Month 1 Critical Path Planning

### Why Month 1 Matters

Month 1 is the **most critical period** of any engagement:
- Sets expectations for quality and pace
- Establishes trust and credibility
- Creates momentum (or stalls it)
- Often determines renewal/expansion decisions

**Rule**: Treat Month 1 as if the entire engagement depends on it — because it often does.

### Month 1 Planning Process

#### Step 1: Identify Contract Month 1 Obligations

From the contract, extract what MUST be delivered in Month 1:
- Scheduled deliverables
- Kickoff meetings
- Initial assessments
- First reports or strategies

#### Step 2: Add Relationship-Building Activities

Beyond deliverables, Month 1 should include:
- Stakeholder 1-on-1s (build rapport)
- Discovery sessions (show curiosity)
- Quick wins (demonstrate value)
- Communication rhythms (establish cadence)

#### Step 3: Sequence by Week

Break Month 1 into 4 weeks with themes:

**Week 1 Theme Examples:**
- "Kickoff & Foundation"
- "Discovery & Alignment"
- "Context Gathering"

**Week 2-3 Theme Examples:**
- "Deep Discovery"
- "Analysis & Synthesis"
- "Solution Exploration"

**Week 4 Theme Examples:**
- "Delivery & Review"
- "Quick Wins & Planning"
- "Month 2 Setup"

#### Step 4: Balance Load

Avoid these Month 1 mistakes:
- ❌ Front-loading (exhausting client Week 1)
- ❌ Back-loading (scrambling Week 4)
- ❌ Meeting-heavy (no time to deliver)
- ❌ Delivery-only (no relationship building)

✅ **Balanced Month 1:**
- Week 1: 60% meetings / 40% delivery
- Week 2: 40% meetings / 60% delivery
- Week 3: 30% meetings / 70% delivery
- Week 4: 20% meetings / 80% delivery (finalizing outputs)

### Month 1 Quick Wins

Every Month 1 should include 1-3 **quick wins** — visible, valuable deliverables that:
- Take < 1 week to complete
- Solve a real pain point (even if small)
- Can be demoed/shown to stakeholders
- Build credibility for larger work ahead

**Quick Win Examples:**
- Dashboard showing real-time data (replaces manual report)
- AI assistant solving specific workflow pain
- Process documentation that didn't exist
- Integration fixing a broken data flow
- Training session with immediate application

**Quick Win Formula:**
```
Quick Win = [Known Pain Point] + [Fast Solution] + [Visible Result]
```

### Week-by-Week Template

```markdown
#### Week [N]: [Theme]

**Key Activities:**
- [ ] [Activity 1] — [Owner] — [Estimated hours]
- [ ] [Activity 2] — [Owner] — [Estimated hours]
- [ ] [Activity 3] — [Owner] — [Estimated hours]

**Meetings Scheduled:**
- [Day]: [Meeting name] — [Attendees] — [Duration] — [Purpose]
- [Day]: [Meeting name] — [Attendees] — [Duration] — [Purpose]

**Deliverables Due:**
- [ ] [Deliverable 1] — Due [specific date]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2] — Due [specific date]

**Quick Wins:**
- [ ] [Quick win name] — [Why it matters]

**Risk Flags:**
- ⚠️ [Potential issue to watch]

**Success Criteria for Week:**
- [How we'll know this week succeeded]
```

---

## Success Metrics Framework

### Three Types of Success Metrics

#### 1. Quantitative (Measurable)
Specific numbers that indicate success:
- Adoption rates (e.g., ">50% team using new system")
- Time savings (e.g., "Reduce report time from 8 hours to 2 hours")
- Quality improvements (e.g., "NPS +10 points")
- Volume metrics (e.g., "Process 100+ transactions through new workflow")

**Format:**
```markdown
**Quantitative Success Criteria:**
1. [Metric]: [Target number/percentage] by [timeframe]
   - How measured: [Methodology]
   - Baseline: [Current state]
```

#### 2. Qualitative (Observable)
Subjective indicators that signal success:
- Client enthusiasm ("They're proactively scheduling Phase 2 discussions")
- Behavioral changes ("Team requesting more training sessions")
- Relationship quality ("Stakeholders introducing us to other departments")
- Cultural shifts ("Leadership citing our work in all-hands meetings")

**Format:**
```markdown
**Qualitative Success Criteria:**
1. [Observable behavior]: [Specific indicator]
   - Evidence: [What we'll see/hear]
   - Source: [Who will show this]
```

#### 3. Expansion Indicators (Phase 2 Signals)
Signs that client wants to expand engagement:
- Unprompted questions about "what's next"
- Requests to include other departments
- Budget conversations for future phases
- Introduction to decision-makers we haven't met
- Asking us to help with adjacent problems

**Format:**
```markdown
**Expansion Indicators:**
- ✅ [Signal 1]: [What to watch for] → [What it means]
- ✅ [Signal 2]: [What to watch for] → [What it means]
```

### Success Metrics Development Process

**Step 1: Extract from Contract/Discovery**
What did the client say success looks like?
- Explicit goals in contract
- Pain points they want solved
- Metrics they mentioned caring about

**Step 2: Add Professional Standards**
What should success look like based on our expertise?
- Industry benchmarks
- Best practices we know
- Quality standards from similar engagements

**Step 3: Make Specific & Measurable**
Transform vague goals into concrete metrics:
- ❌ "Improve efficiency"
- ✅ "Reduce monthly reporting time from 8 hours to < 2 hours"

**Step 4: Assign Timeframes**
When should each metric be achieved?
- Month 1 metrics (immediate wins)
- Phase 1 metrics (end of engagement)
- Long-term metrics (6-12 months post-engagement)

### Quick Wins as Success Metrics

Month 1-2 should include **quick wins** that become proof points:

**Quick Win Success Criteria:**
```markdown
**Month 1 Quick Wins:**
1. [Quick win name]: [Complete by Week X]
   - Success = [Specific outcome]
   - Impact = [Who benefits + how much]
   - Proof = [How we'll demonstrate]

Example:
1. Board Dashboard: Complete by Week 3
   - Success = CEO can access real-time financials without IT help
   - Impact = CFO saves 1 day/month of manual reporting
   - Proof = Dashboard demo at Monthly Business Review #1
```

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Do These Well (Success Factors)

Generate 6-8 items that will drive engagement success.

**Categories to Consider:**
1. **Delivery Excellence**
   - What deliverables are most critical?
   - What quality standards matter most?

2. **Relationship Management**
   - Which stakeholders are key?
   - What communication patterns are essential?

3. **Technical Execution**
   - What technical challenges must we nail?
   - What implementations can't fail?

4. **Strategic Positioning**
   - What will drive Phase 2 conversion?
   - What builds long-term partnership?

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Do These Well

1. **[Success Factor Name]**
   - **Why it matters:** [Strategic importance]
   - **How to achieve:** [Specific approach]
   - **Risk if neglected:** [What fails]
   - **Owner:** [Who's accountable]
   - **Evidence:** [From discovery/contract]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
1. **Deliver Month 1 Perfectly**
   - **Why:** Client explicitly said "first month is make or break"
   - **How:** Week-by-week checklist, no missed deadlines, over-communicate
   - **Risk:** Lose credibility, risk non-renewal, no Phase 2
   - **Owner:** Engagement lead
   - **Evidence:** Quote from kickoff: "Previous consultants failed Month 1"
```

### Avoid These Risks (Failure Modes)

Generate 6-8 items that could derail the engagement.

**Risk Categories:**
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Where might scope expand uncontrollably?
   - What requests should we politely decline?

2. **Relationship Risks**
   - Which stakeholders could undermine us?
   - What political dynamics could hurt us?

3. **Technical Failures**
   - What implementations might fail?
   - What integrations are fragile?

4. **Resource Constraints**
   - Where might we overcommit?
   - What dependencies could block us?

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Avoid These Risks

1. **[Risk Name]**
   - **Danger:** [What could go wrong]
   - **Why it matters:** [Impact if it happens]
   - **Probability:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
   - **Mitigation:** [How to prevent]
   - **Trigger signals:** [Early warning signs]
   - **Evidence:** [Why we think this is a risk]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
1. **Scope Creep from Implementation Expectations**
   - **Danger:** Client expects full implementation, contract is strategy-focused
   - **Why:** Could drain resources, miss contracted deliverables, relationship damage
   - **Probability:** HIGH (client said "we want to blow up tech stack")
   - **Mitigation:** Continuously clarify Phase 1 vs Phase 2 scope, document all requests, propose Phase 2 for implementation
   - **Trigger signals:** Client asking "when will you build this" instead of "how should we build this"
   - **Evidence:** Discovery revealed implementation expectations despite strategy contract
```

### Risk Prioritization Matrix

Prioritize risks by **Impact × Probability**:

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | High impact + High probability | Address immediately, dedicated mitigation plan |
| **MAJOR** | High impact + Med probability OR Med impact + High probability | Monitor closely, prepare mitigation |
| **MODERATE** | Med impact + Med probability | Periodic monitoring, basic mitigation |
| **MINOR** | Low impact OR Low probability | Acknowledge, no active mitigation |

### Pattern-Based Risk Identification

Look for these patterns in discovery that signal specific risks:

**Pattern → Risk:**
- ⚠️ Contradictions in discovery → **Alignment Risk** (stakeholders not on same page)
- Past vendor failures mentioned → **Differentiation Risk** (will they view us same as previous?)
- "We tried this before" statements → **Change Fatigue Risk** (resistance to new approaches)
- Single decision-maker mentioned → **Key Person Risk** (what if they leave?)
- Budget concerns raised → **Funding Risk** (will money be there for Phase 2?)
- Implementation language in strategy contract → **Scope Creep Risk** (mismatched expectations)

## Immediate Actions Framework

### Three Action Categories

#### 1. Your Priority Actions (Strategist)
What YOU must do this week to move engagement forward:
- Prep for upcoming meetings
- Review key documents
- Reach out to stakeholders
- Clarify ambiguous items
- Make key decisions

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Your Priority Actions
- [ ] [Action] — By [specific date/time]
  - Why: [Importance]
  - Blockers: [What could prevent this]
```

#### 2. Team Priority Actions
What TEAM MEMBERS must do:
- Assign owner to each action
- Set specific deadlines
- Note dependencies

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Team Priority Actions
- [ ] [Action] — [Owner name] — By [date]
  - Context: [Why this matters]
  - Dependency: [What needs to happen first]
```

#### 3. Clarification Needed
Questions that need answers before proceeding:
- Scope ambiguities
- Missing information
- Contradictory intelligence

**Format:**
```markdown
#### Clarification Needed
- [ ] [Question] — Ask [specific person] — By [date]
  - Why urgent: [Impact of not knowing]
  - What we think: [Best guess if we can't get answer]
```

### Action Prioritization

Use this hierarchy:

**P0 (This Week, Blocking):**
- Required for Week 1 meetings
- Blocking other work
- Client explicitly requested

**P1 (This Week, Important):**
- Month 1 deliverables
- Relationship building
- Quick wins

**P2 (Next Week, Valuable):**
- Month 2 setup
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Future phase prep

## Execution Calendar Template

### Month-by-Month View (Months 2-6)

After detailed Month 1 planning, provide high-level view of remaining months:

```markdown
### Month 2: [Theme]

**Primary Focus:** [What this month is about]

**Key Deliverables:**
- [ ] [Deliverable 1] — Due [date]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2] — Due [date]

**Milestones:**
- [Milestone name]: [Target date]

**Success Criteria:**
- [How we'll know Month 2 succeeded]

### Month 3-6: [Continue pattern]
```

### Timeline Constraint Integration

Weave in constraints from discovery:

```markdown
**December Timeline Notes:**
- Dec 3, 9: Client blocked (holidays)
- Dec 16: Lincoln Learn event (opportunity to attend?)
- Dec 20-31: Reduced capacity expected
- Weekly L10: Mondays 1:30pm EST (recurring)

**Plan around constraints:**
- Schedule major deliveries before Dec 15
- No client meetings Dec 20-31
- Use reduced capacity period for internal work
```

---

## Cultural Intelligence in Execution Planning

### Applying Cultural Attributes

From discovery, extract cultural attributes and **operationalize them**:

**Example:**
```markdown
**Cultural Attribute:** "Want to be challenged, not validated"

**Execution Implications:**
- ✅ Do: Push back on ideas, propose alternatives, play devil's advocate
- ❌ Avoid: Just agreeing with everything, being overly diplomatic
- 📋 Actions: In every presentation, include "Alternative Approaches" slide
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Cultural Attribute:** "As much as we can do off the shelf"

**Execution Implications:**
- ✅ Do: Prioritize SaaS solutions, emphasize proven tools
- ❌ Avoid: Proposing custom development, "we'll build it" language
- 📋 Actions: Always show 3 vendor options before suggesting custom
```

### Communication Preferences

Adapt execution based on discovered preferences:

| If They Said... | Then Execute... |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "We're data-driven" | Lead with metrics, back up recommendations with numbers |
| "We value transparency" | Over-communicate, share work-in-progress early |
| "We move fast" | Compress timelines, bias toward action over analysis |
| "We're risk-averse" | Show proof points, provide case studies, staged rollouts |

## Phase 2 Conversion Strategy

### Signals to Track

Throughout Phase 1, watch for these Phase 2 conversion signals:

✅ **Strong Signals (High Probability):**
- "Can you help us with [adjacent problem]?"
- "What would Phase 2 look like?"
- Introducing you to budget holders
- Asking about your availability next quarter

✅ **Moderate Signals:**
- Enthusiasm about current work
- Asking detailed questions about capabilities
- Inviting you to more meetings
- Sharing strategic plans for next year

✅ **Weak Signals:**
- General satisfaction ("this is going well")
- Completing contracted work without issues
- Positive relationship but no forward-looking discussions

### Phase 2 Scoping Process

**When to Start:** Month 4 of 6-month engagement (or 2/3 through timeline)

**Process:**
1. **Synthesize opportunities** from discovery (especially 💡 client-originated)
2. **Prioritize by DVF** (Desirable, Viable, Feasible)
3. **Estimate scope** (time, cost, resources)
4. **Draft Phase 2 SOW** with 3-5 workstreams
5. **Present options** (light/medium/comprehensive)
6. **Negotiate scope** based on budget/timeline
7. **Secure commitment** before Phase 1 ends

**Phase 2 Pricing Model:**
- Typically 1-2x Phase 1 value
- Monthly retainer for ongoing work
- Project-based for discrete implementations
- Hybrid (retainer + project fees)

### Transition Strategy

**Last Month of Phase 1:**
- Week 1-2: Present Phase 2 proposal
- Week 3: Negotiate and finalize
- Week 4: Sign Phase 2 while delivering Phase 1 final deliverables

**Avoid the Gap:**
❌ Don't let there be a gap between Phase 1 end and Phase 2 start
✅ Do overlap: Sign Phase 2 before Phase 1 ends
