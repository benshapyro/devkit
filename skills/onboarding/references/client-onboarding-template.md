## Formatting Best Practices

### Use of Tables

- **Keep concise**: 3-7 rows ideal, max 10 rows before splitting

### Use of Checkboxes
- **When to use**: Action items, deliverables tracking, success criteria monitoring
- **Format**: `- [ ] Action item — Owner — Due date`

### Use of Insight Markers
- ⚡ **Surprises**: Information that contradicts expectations
- 💡 **Client-originated**: Ideas client specifically requested
- 🔄 **Patterns**: Themes appearing 3+ times
- ⚠️ **Contradictions**: Conflicting information needing resolution
- 🔧 **Consultant ideas**: Solutions we're proposing

### Evidence Citation Format
```markdown
**Quote:** "Exact words from stakeholder"  
**Source:** [Name], [unprompted/prompted], [Session date/document]  
**Confidence:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
```

### Quantification Examples
✅ Good:
- "~$3.6M annual revenue from 3 streams"
- "15,000 visitors annually to 70,000 sq ft campus"
- "Controller spends 1 full day/month on reporting"

❌ Bad:

- "Substantial time on reporting"
