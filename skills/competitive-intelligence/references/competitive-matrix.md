## Best Practices

### Building Matrices

1. **Define scope clearly** - What features/capabilities are being compared
2. **Use consistent criteria** - Same evaluation method across all vendors
3. **Be honest** - Include areas where competitors are stronger
4. **Include context** - "Why it matters" column for features
5. **Date everything** - Features change; timestamps are critical
6. **Source your data** - Note how you evaluated (demo, docs, customer feedback)

### Avoiding Bias

1. **Don't cherry-pick features** - Include capabilities where you're weak
2. **Use third-party validation** - G2, Gartner, analyst reports
3. **Include customer perspective** - What buyers actually care about
4. **Test competitor products** - Don't rely only on marketing materials
5. **Get sales input** - They hear competitive objections daily

### Keeping Current

- Review matrices quarterly minimum
- Update immediately for major competitor releases
- Track feature velocity (who's shipping faster)
- Note deprecated/removed features
