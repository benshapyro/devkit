# Cognitive Science Principles for Presentations

## Working Memory Limits

**Core constraint**: Humans can hold 3-4 chunks of information simultaneously in working memory (not 7±2 as commonly believed).

**Application rules**:
- Maximum 3-4 bullet points per slide
- Maximum 3-4 main sections in presentation
- Maximum 3-4 colors or fonts
- Maximum 3-4 data series on one chart

**Why it matters**: Exceeding working memory capacity causes:
- 40% drop in retention
- Increased cognitive load
- Audience disengagement
- Failure to transfer to long-term memory

**Chunking strategies**:
- Group related items together
- Use visual hierarchy to create super-chunks
- Progressive disclosure for complex concepts
- Nested structures (3 main points, each with 3 sub-points)

## Serial Position Effects

**Primacy Effect**: First 20% of presentation transfers to long-term memory
**Recency Effect**: Last 20% remains in working memory for action

**Strategic placement**:
- **Primacy zone** (first 20%): Most critical messages, key insights, big idea
- **Danger zone** (middle 60%): Most forgotten, needs repetition and breaks
- **Recency zone** (last 20%): Call-to-action, next steps, decisions needed

**Implementation**:
- Place recommendation/conclusion in first 3 slides
- Repeat key messages 3x: Primacy → Middle (with example) → Recency
- Save actionable next steps for final 20%
- Never bury critical info in slides 10-15 of 20-slide deck

## Attention and Cognitive Breaks

**Attention decay**:
- Minute 0-10: High attention (primacy effect)
- Minute 10-20: Declining attention (requires reset)
- Minute 20+: Significant fatigue without intervention

**Cognitive break schedule**:
- **Every 10 minutes**: 30-second break (story, visual, anecdote)
- **Every 20 minutes**: 2-minute interactive element (poll, discussion, question)
- **Every 40 minutes**: 5-minute physical break (stand, stretch, bio-break)

**Break types**:
- Story/anecdote: Activates different brain regions
- Visual surprise: Striking image or short video
- Interactive: Questions, polls, think-pair-share
- Physical: Movement resets attention systems
- Humor: Releases tension, creates positive association

**Warning signs of cognitive overload**:
- Phone checking increases
- Fidgeting or shifting
- Glazed expressions
- Side conversations
- Question quality decreases

## Channel Synchronization

**Dual-channel processing**: Humans process visual and verbal information separately

**Rules for synchronization**:
1. **Don't read bullet points verbatim** - Causes 50% comprehension drop
2. **Align visual with verbal** - What they see should support what they hear
3. **Use visuals to amplify** - Charts/images complement spoken words
4. **Avoid channel conflict** - Never show text A while saying text B

**Good synchronization**:
- Slide shows chart → You explain the insight
- Slide shows image → You tell related story
- Slide shows framework → You walk through each component

**Bad synchronization**:
- Slide has paragraphs → You read them word-for-word
- Slide shows unrelated visual → You discuss different topic
- Multiple competing visuals → Attention splits, comprehension drops

## Information Processing and Cognitive Load

**Three types of cognitive load**:

**1. Intrinsic Load** (inherent complexity)
- Minimize: Break complex topics into stages
- Example: Don't show entire process at once, build progressively

**2. Extraneous Load** (poor design)
- Eliminate: Remove chartjunk, excessive text, confusing layouts
- Example: Remove 3D effects, unnecessary gridlines, decorative elements

**3. Germane Load** (productive thinking)
- Maximize: Create space for understanding and insight
- Example: Whitespace, clear examples, thoughtful analogies

**Goal**: Minimize intrinsic and extraneous to maximize germane processing

## 30-Word Rule

**Research finding**: Retention drops 40% when slides exceed 30 words

**Why 30 words works**:
- Fits comfortably in working memory
- Can be scanned in 3-5 seconds
- Leaves cognitive capacity for verbal channel
- Forces clarity and precision

**Exceptions** (use sparingly):
- Executive summary slide (first slide can be 40-50 words)
- Technical specifications (move to appendix instead)
- Legal/compliance disclaimers (footer text doesn't count)

**30-word techniques**:
- Action titles instead of topic labels
- Bullet fragments, not full sentences
- Move details to speaker notes
- Use visuals to replace words
- Create separate slides instead of cramming

## Memory Formation and Retention

**Repetition requirement**: Information needs 3 exposures to transfer to long-term memory

**3x repetition pattern**:
1. **Introduction** (primacy): State key message clearly
2. **Example** (middle): Illustrate with concrete example/story
3. **Summary** (recency): Restate key message with implications

**Spacing matters**:
- Exposures should be 5-15 minutes apart
- Different context each time (fact → story → action)
- Not back-to-back (defeats purpose)

**Memory enhancement techniques**:
- **Yellow highlighting**: 55-78% retention boost for key concepts
- **Stories**: 22x more memorable than facts alone
- **Concrete examples**: 5x more memorable than abstractions
- **Visual metaphors**: Aid recall and understanding
- **Emotional connection**: Activates amygdala, improves encoding

## Psychological Distance and Abstraction

**Construal Level Theory**: Psychological distance affects how we process information

**Close psychological distance**:
- Specific, concrete examples
- How-to instructions
- Immediate next steps
- Works for implementation audiences

**Far psychological distance**:
- Abstract concepts and frameworks
- Why it matters
- Vision and strategy
- Works for executive audiences

**Application**:
- Board presentations: Higher abstraction, strategic frameworks
- Implementation teams: Concrete examples, specific steps
- Mixed audiences: Start abstract, progressively add concrete examples

## Cognitive Biases in Presentations

**Confirmation Bias**:
- Acknowledge competing perspectives upfront
- Use "Yes, and..." not "Yes, but..."
- Present data that might contradict, then explain

**Recency Bias**:
- Most recent information disproportionately influential
- Use deliberately for action items (place at end)
- Counter by reinforcing key messages throughout

**Anchoring**:
- First number sets reference point
- Start with context before revealing metrics
- Use comparison frameworks to prevent misinterpretation

**Status Quo Bias**:
- People prefer current state
- Quantify cost of inaction
- Make change seem less risky than status quo

## Visual Processing Speed

**Eye-tracking findings**:
- First 2.6 seconds: Attention to high-contrast, large elements
- Next 4 seconds: Reading text (if present)
- Subsequent time: Exploration based on initial scan

**Design implications**:
- Most important element should be largest and highest contrast
- Critical text should be top-left (F-pattern) or top-right (Z-pattern)
- Visual hierarchy must be obvious in first 3 seconds
- Don't hide key insights in small text or footnotes

**F-Pattern** (text-heavy):
- 69% of viewing time on left side
- Horizontal scans at top decrease in length moving down
- Vertical scan down left side

**Z-Pattern** (visual-dominant):
- Top-left to top-right
- Diagonal to bottom-left
- Bottom-left to bottom-right

## Decision Fatigue

**Progressive cognitive drain**:
- Early presentation: High-quality decisions possible
- Mid-presentation: Decision quality decreases
- Late presentation: Default to status quo or simple options

**Countermeasures**:
- Make asks early (primacy zone) or build to climax
- Reduce decision complexity (max 3 options)
- Provide clear recommendation with supporting rationale
- Use cognitive breaks to reset decision capacity
- Frame decisions as reversible when possible

## Learning Principles for Training Presentations

**Retrieval Practice**:
- Include questions that make audience recall information
- Better than passive review
- Spaced throughout presentation

**Interleaving**:
- Mix concepts rather than blocking by topic
- Improves transfer and application
- Example: Concept A → Concept B → back to A with new example

**Concrete-Abstract-Concrete**:
- Start with concrete example
- Introduce abstract principle
- Return to different concrete application
- Maximizes understanding and retention

**Worked Examples**:
- Show complete solution process
- Explain decision points
- More effective than problem-solving practice initially
