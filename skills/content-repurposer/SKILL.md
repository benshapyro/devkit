# Content Repurposer

Transform one piece of content into many formats across platforms.

## Quick Start

**Blog Post → Social Media:**

```markdown
# Repurposing: [Blog Title]

## Source Content
- URL: [Blog URL]
- Word Count: [X words]
- Key Points: 3-5 main takeaways

## Outputs

### LinkedIn Post
[Hook - 1 line]

[Key insight - 2-3 lines]

Here's what I learned:
1. [Point 1]
2. [Point 2]
3. [Point 3]

[CTA - question or link in comments]

---

### Twitter Thread
1/ [Hook - make them want to read more]

2/ [Context - why this matters]

3/ [Key point 1]

4/ [Key point 2]

5/ [Key point 3]

6/ [Takeaway + CTA + link]

---

### Instagram Carousel
Slide 1: [Title]
Slide 2: [Problem/Hook]
Slide 3-6: [Key points]
Slide 7: [Summary]
Slide 8: [CTA]
```

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Audit

Before repurposing, evaluate the source:

```markdown
# Content Audit: [Title]

## Source Assessment
| Factor | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Evergreen value | [X] | [Will this age well?] |
| Visual potential | [X] | [Can we add graphics/video?] |
| Shareability | [X] | [Will people share?] |
| Platform fit | [X] | [Where does this work?] |
| Update needed | [Y/N] | [Is info current?] |

## Key Messages
1. [Core message 1]
2. [Core message 2]
3. [Core message 3]

## Quotables
- "[Memorable quote 1]"
- "[Memorable quote 2]"

## Data Points
- [Statistic 1]
- [Statistic 2]

## Repurposing Potential: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Phase 2: Format Selection

Choose output formats based on source content:

| Source Format | Best Repurposed As |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Blog post | Social threads, newsletter, video script, carousel |
| Podcast episode | Blog post, audiogram, quote graphics, clips |
| Video/Webinar | Blog post, clips, GIFs, quote graphics |
| Newsletter | Blog post, social posts, thread |
| Case study | Social proof posts, video testimonial, slides |
| Data/Research | Infographic, thread, carousel, blog deep-dive |

### Phase 3: Transformation

For each target format:

1. **Extract key elements** from source
2. **Adapt structure** for platform norms
3. **Adjust length** per platform limits
4. **Optimize hooks** for each audience
5. **Add platform-specific elements** (hashtags, mentions, visuals)

### Phase 4: Platform Optimization

| Platform | Length | Visuals | Hashtags | Link Placement |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| LinkedIn | 1,300 chars optimal | Optional, helps | 3-5 | Comments |
| Twitter/X | 280/tweet, threads 5-15 | Optional | 0-2 | Last tweet |
| Instagram | 2,200 max | Required | 5-15 | Bio link |
| YouTube | Varies by format | Required | N/A | Description |
| TikTok | 150 chars | Required | 3-5 | N/A |

See `references/platform-specs.md` for detailed specifications.

### Phase 5: Scheduling

Stagger distribution for maximum reach:

```
Day 0: Publish original (blog/video/podcast)
Day 0: Twitter thread
Day 0-1: LinkedIn post
Day 1: Email newsletter
Day 1-2: Instagram carousel
Day 3: Second LinkedIn angle
Day 7: Reshare with new hook
Day 14: Platform you missed
Day 30+: Evergreen reshare
```

## When to Use

**This skill is appropriate when:**
- Converting blog content to social media posts
- Creating video clips from longer content
- Turning podcasts into written articles
- Adapting webinars for on-demand consumption
- Maximizing ROI from high-effort content
- Distributing content across multiple channels

**Trigger keywords:**
- "repurpose", "repurposing"
- "blog to social", "blog to Twitter"
- "video clips", "podcast to blog"
- "content distribution", "cross-platform"
- "turn this into", "convert to"

## When NOT to Use

- **Creating original content:** This is for transformation, not creation
- **Content calendar planning:** Use `editorial-calendar` skill
- **Single-platform native content:** Just create directly
- **Highly technical transformations:** Video editing, design work
- **Content that can't be adapted:** Highly platform-specific pieces

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Copy-Paste Across Platforms
**Problem:** Identical content on every platform performs poorly
**Solution:** Adapt format, hook, and structure for each platform's norms

### 2. Ignoring Platform Context
**Problem:** LinkedIn language on Twitter, Twitter brevity on LinkedIn
**Solution:** Study how native content performs on each platform

### 3. Repurposing Everything
**Problem:** Low-quality source = low-quality derivatives
**Solution:** Only repurpose content that performed well or has evergreen value

### 4. Forgetting the Hook
**Problem:** Same intro doesn't work everywhere
**Solution:** Write platform-specific hooks that stop the scroll

### 5. No Visual Adaptation
**Problem:** Text-only on visual platforms, over-designed on text platforms
**Solution:** Match visual expectations per platform

### 6. Rushing Publication
**Problem:** All derivatives go out same day, cannibalizing each other
**Solution:** Stagger distribution over days/weeks

### 7. Not Tracking Performance
**Problem:** Don't know which formats work for which sources
**Solution:** Track derivative performance to inform future repurposing
