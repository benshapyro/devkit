## Framework Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Porter's 5 Forces | BCG Matrix | SWOT | McKinsey 7S |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|------|-------------|
| **Focus** | External industry | Portfolio allocation | Internal + External | Internal alignment |
| **Time Horizon** | Current state | Strategic planning | Point-in-time | Current vs. desired |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Low-Medium | Low | High |
| **Data Required** | Industry data | Market share, growth | Varied | Organizational insight |
| **Best For** | Market analysis | Resource decisions | Quick assessment | Change management |
| **Output** | Industry attractiveness | Investment priorities | Strategic options | Alignment gaps |

## When to Combine Frameworks

### Market Entry Analysis
1. **Porter's Five Forces** - Assess industry attractiveness
2. **SWOT** - Evaluate your fit and capabilities
3. **Result:** Go/no-go decision with strategy

### Annual Strategic Planning
1. **SWOT** - Broad situational assessment
2. **BCG Matrix** - Portfolio resource allocation
3. **McKinsey 7S** - Organizational readiness
4. **Result:** Comprehensive strategic plan

### M&A Due Diligence
1. **Porter's Five Forces** - Target's industry dynamics
2. **SWOT** - Target's position and our synergies
3. **McKinsey 7S** - Integration planning
4. **Result:** Acquisition decision + integration plan

### Competitive Response
1. **Porter's Five Forces** - Understand competitive dynamics
2. **SWOT** - Assess relative strengths/weaknesses
3. **Result:** Competitive strategy

## Anti-Patterns: Wrong Framework for the Job

| Situation | Wrong Choice | Right Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| "Should we enter China?" | BCG Matrix | Porter's Five Forces | BCG is for existing portfolio, not new markets |
| "Why is our strategy failing?" | Porter's Five Forces | McKinsey 7S | Execution issues are internal, not industry |
| "Quick board update" | McKinsey 7S | SWOT | 7S is too detailed for quick overview |
| "Where to invest next year?" | SWOT | BCG Matrix | BCG specifically addresses resource allocation |
| "Non-profit strategic planning" | Porter's Five Forces | SWOT + 7S | Porter's assumes profit-seeking dynamics |

## Framework Limitations

### Porter's Five Forces
- Assumes stable industry structure (poor for dynamic tech)
- Ignores network effects and platform dynamics
- Doesn't address internal capabilities
- Best when: Industry dynamics are primary concern

### BCG Matrix
- Only two dimensions (share + growth)
- Assumes cash flow correlates with position
- Ignores synergies between units
- Best when: Clear portfolio of distinct products/units

### SWOT Analysis
- Subjective without data validation
- Can become laundry list without prioritization
- Static snapshot (needs regular updates)
- Best when: Starting point or quick assessment

### McKinsey 7S
- Complex and time-consuming
- Requires deep organizational knowledge
- Hard to quantify soft elements
- Best when: Significant organizational change planned

1. **Am I analyzing an industry or my organization?**
   - Industry → Porter's Five Forces
   - Organization → 7S or SWOT

2. **Do I need to allocate resources across products?**
   - Yes → BCG Matrix
   - No → Other frameworks

3. **Is this a quick assessment or deep analysis?**
   - Quick → SWOT
   - Deep → Porter's, 7S, or combination

4. **Am I planning organizational change?**
   - Yes → McKinsey 7S
   - No → Other frameworks

5. **Do I need actionable strategy or just understanding?**
   - Actionable → SWOT with TOWS conversion
