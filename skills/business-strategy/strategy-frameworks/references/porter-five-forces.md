# Porter's Five Forces - Deep Dive

## Overview

Porter's Five Forces analyzes industry competitive dynamics to understand market attractiveness and profitability drivers. Created by Michael Porter at Harvard Business School.

## Detailed Methodology

### Step 1: Define Industry Scope

**Critical first step.** Poor scope definition leads to meaningless analysis.

**Too Broad:**
- "Food industry" (includes everything from farming to restaurants)
- "Technology sector" (too diverse)

**Too Narrow:**
- "Gluten-free organic pizza in Brooklyn" (not a true industry)
- "Cloud storage for law firms" (niche, not industry)

**Just Right:**
- "Fast-casual restaurant chains in US urban markets"
- "Enterprise cloud infrastructure services"
- "Electric vehicle manufacturing"

**Scope Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear geographic boundary
- [ ] Defined customer segment
- [ ] Specific product/service category
- [ ] Competitors can be named

### Step 2: Analyze Each Force

#### Force 1: Threat of New Entrants

**Key Questions:**
- What capital is required to enter?
- Are there regulatory barriers (licenses, certifications)?
- Do incumbents have economies of scale?
- How strong is brand loyalty?
- Is distribution access difficult?
- Are there network effects?

**Rating Guide:**

| Rating | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| HIGH threat | Low capital, weak brands, easy access, no regulations |
| MODERATE | Some barriers but surmountable, occasional new entrants |
| LOW threat | High capital, strong brands, regulatory moats, network effects |

**Common Entry Barriers:**
- Economies of scale (cost advantages at volume)
- Capital requirements (upfront investment)
- Switching costs (customer lock-in)
- Access to distribution channels
- Proprietary technology/patents
- Government policy/regulation
- Brand identity/reputation

#### Force 2: Bargaining Power of Buyers

**Key Questions:**
- How concentrated are buyers vs. sellers?
- What are buyer switching costs?
- How price-sensitive are buyers?
- Can buyers backward integrate?
- How important is your product to buyer's quality?
- Do buyers have full information?

**Rating Guide:**

| Rating | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| HIGH power | Few large buyers, commodity product, low switching costs |
| MODERATE | Mixed concentration, some differentiation |
| LOW power | Fragmented buyers, differentiated product, high switching costs |

**Buyer Power Increases When:**
- Purchases are large % of buyer's costs
- Products are standardized/undifferentiated
- Switching costs are low
- Buyers could make the product themselves
- Product doesn't affect buyer's quality significantly

#### Force 3: Bargaining Power of Suppliers

**Key Questions:**
- How many suppliers exist for critical inputs?
- Are there substitute inputs available?
- What % of supplier revenue do you represent?
- How important is their input to your product?
- Can suppliers forward integrate?
- What are switching costs?

**Rating Guide:**

| Rating | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| HIGH power | Few suppliers, unique inputs, high switching costs |
| MODERATE | Some alternatives, moderate dependency |
| LOW power | Many suppliers, commodity inputs, easy switching |

**Supplier Power Increases When:**
- Supplier industry is concentrated
- No substitute inputs exist
- Industry is not important customer for supplier
- Supplier's product is critical to buyer's business
- Supplier has differentiated products
- Supplier could forward integrate

#### Force 4: Threat of Substitutes

**Key Questions:**
- What alternative solutions exist outside the industry?
- What's the price-performance trade-off?
- What are switching costs to substitutes?
- How does buyer propensity to substitute?
- Are substitutes improving in price/performance?

**Rating Guide:**

| Rating | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| HIGH threat | Many alternatives, better price-performance, low switching |
| MODERATE | Some alternatives with trade-offs |
| LOW threat | Few alternatives, inferior performance, high switching |

**Substitute Analysis:**
- Direct substitutes (alternative products)
- Indirect substitutes (alternative ways to solve problem)
- "Do nothing" as substitute
- Technology disruption potential

#### Force 5: Competitive Rivalry

**Key Questions:**
- How many competitors exist?
- Is industry growing or mature/declining?
- What are exit barriers?
- Are products differentiated or commoditized?
- Are fixed costs high (driving price competition)?
- Is there diversity of competitors?

**Rating Guide:**

| Rating | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| HIGH rivalry | Many similar competitors, slow growth, commodity products |
| MODERATE | Some differentiation, moderate growth |
| LOW rivalry | Few competitors, high differentiation, growing market |

**Rivalry Intensifies When:**
- Numerous or equally balanced competitors
- Industry growth is slow
- Fixed costs are high
- Products lack differentiation
- Switching costs are low
- Exit barriers are high
- Stakes are high (strategic importance)

### Step 3: Assess Industry Attractiveness

**Overall Rating:**
- If 3+ forces are HIGH → Industry unattractive (low profitability)
- If 3+ forces are LOW → Industry attractive (high profitability)
- Mixed → Depends on which forces dominate

**Strategic Implications by Attractiveness:**

| Attractiveness | Implications |
|----------------|--------------|
| High | Invest aggressively, expand market share |
| Moderate | Selective investment, differentiation focus |
| Low | Harvest/divest, or find defensible niche |

### Step 4: Develop Strategic Responses

For each force, identify actions to improve position:

| Force | Defense Strategies |
|-------|-------------------|
| New Entrants | Build brand, increase switching costs, proprietary tech, scale |
| Buyer Power | Differentiate, serve multiple segments, increase switching costs |
| Supplier Power | Diversify suppliers, backward integrate, standardize inputs |
| Substitutes | Improve value proposition, increase switching costs, embrace/acquire |
| Rivalry | Differentiate, find niches, improve efficiency, consolidate |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Industry scope too broad** - "Software industry" is meaningless; specify segment
2. **Treating forces equally** - Some forces dominate in certain industries
3. **Superficial analysis** - Dig into WHY each factor exists
4. **Static snapshot** - Update as conditions change
5. **No action items** - Analysis without strategy is academic
6. **Ignoring macro factors** - Government policy, technology trends matter
7. **Over-quantification** - Subjective ratings are inherently imprecise
8. **Customer-centricity gap** - Don't forget the customer in competitive focus

## 2026 Considerations

**Digital Economy Additions:**
Some analysts add two forces for digital businesses:
- **Threat of Partnerships** - Platform/ecosystem dynamics
- **Threat of Technological Advancement** - Disruption risk

**Network Effects:**
Traditional Porter analysis underweights network effects. For platform businesses, consider:
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- Multi-sided market dynamics
- Data advantages as barrier
