# SWOT Analysis - Deep Dive

## Overview

SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning framework for identifying internal capabilities and external factors affecting an organization or decision.

## Detailed Methodology

### Step 1: Define Clear Objective

**Critical first step.** Unfocused SWOT produces unfocused results.

**Good Objectives:**
- "Should we enter the European market?"
- "How should we respond to new competitor X?"
- "What's our strategic position for the next 3 years?"
- "Should we launch product Y?"

**Bad Objectives:**
- "Do a SWOT analysis" (no decision context)
- "Understand our situation" (too vague)

### Step 2: Gather Cross-Functional Input

**Who to Include:**
- Leadership team
- Sales (customer-facing insights)
- Operations (capability reality check)
- Finance (resource constraints)
- Customers (external perspective)
- External advisors (objectivity)

**Avoid:**
- Single-person analysis (too narrow)
- Only leadership (misses ground-level reality)
- Only optimists or pessimists (biased)

### Step 3: Analyze Internal Factors

#### Strengths (Internal, Positive)

**Definition:** Internal capabilities that provide competitive advantage.

**Key Questions:**
- What do we do better than competitors?
- What unique resources or capabilities do we have?
- What do customers see as our strengths?
- What recent successes can we build on?
- What's our unfair advantage?

**Categories to Consider:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Financial | Strong cash position, high margins, low debt |
| Human | Expert team, low turnover, unique expertise |
| Physical | Prime location, modern equipment, capacity |
| Intellectual | Patents, proprietary tech, brand, data |
| Operational | Efficient processes, quality systems |
| Relational | Customer loyalty, partner network |

**Quality Criteria for Strengths:**
- Specific and measurable (not vague)
- Truly differentiating (not table stakes)
- Evidence-based (not wishful thinking)

**Example:**
- ❌ "Good customer service" (vague)
- ✅ "95% customer satisfaction, 24/7 support team, 2-hour response SLA" (specific)

#### Weaknesses (Internal, Negative)

**Definition:** Internal limitations that hinder performance.

**Key Questions:**
- Where do competitors outperform us?
- What resources or capabilities are we lacking?
- What do customers complain about?
- What recent failures reveal vulnerabilities?
- What do we avoid because we're not good at it?

**Categories to Consider:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Financial | Cash constraints, thin margins, high debt |
| Human | Skill gaps, high turnover, leadership gaps |
| Physical | Outdated equipment, capacity limits |
| Intellectual | No patents, weak brand, data gaps |
| Operational | Inefficient processes, quality issues |
| Relational | Customer churn, partner conflicts |

**Honesty Check:**
- Would an objective outsider agree?
- Are we being defensive?
- What would our competitors say?

### Step 4: Analyze External Factors

#### Opportunities (External, Positive)

**Definition:** External conditions that could be exploited for benefit.

**Key Questions:**
- What market trends favor our business model?
- Are there underserved customer segments?
- What regulatory or technology changes create openings?
- Can we form strategic partnerships?
- What are competitors doing poorly?

**Categories to Consider:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Market | Growing segments, unmet needs, new demographics |
| Technology | New platforms, automation, digital channels |
| Regulatory | Deregulation, new standards, subsidies |
| Economic | Consumer spending, interest rates, globalization |
| Competitive | Competitor weakness, market exit, consolidation |
| Social | Lifestyle trends, values shifts, demographic changes |

**Opportunity vs. Goal:**
- ❌ "Increase market share" (that's your goal)
- ✅ "Competitor X exiting market, freeing 15% share" (that's an opportunity)

#### Threats (External, Negative)

**Definition:** External conditions that could harm the organization.

**Key Questions:**
- What are competitors doing that could hurt us?
- What market trends work against us?
- What regulatory or technology changes pose risks?
- Are substitute products emerging?
- What economic factors threaten us?

**Categories to Consider:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Competitive | New entrants, aggressive pricing, innovation |
| Technology | Disruption, obsolescence, cyber threats |
| Regulatory | New regulations, tariffs, compliance costs |
| Economic | Recession, inflation, currency volatility |
| Social | Changing preferences, reputation risks |
| Environmental | Climate impacts, sustainability requirements |

**Internal vs. External Check:**
- Strengths/Weaknesses = Things WE control
- Opportunities/Threats = Things EXTERNAL to us

**Common Misclassifications:**
- "Employee turnover" = Weakness (internal), not Threat
- "New competitor" = Threat (external), not Weakness
- "We should expand" = Goal, not Opportunity

### Step 5: Prioritize (Top 3-5 per Quadrant)

**Prioritization Criteria:**
| Factor | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| Impact | How much does this affect our objective? |
| Probability | How likely is this to matter? |
| Timeframe | Is this immediate or long-term? |
| Actionability | Can we actually do something about it? |

**Voting Method (for groups):**
1. Each person gets 3 votes per quadrant
2. Vote on most important items
3. Discuss top vote-getters
4. Finalize top 3-5 per quadrant

### Step 6: Convert to Action (TOWS Matrix)

**TOWS = SWOT reversed** - focuses on strategic actions.

| | Opportunities | Threats |
|---|---------------|---------|
| **Strengths** | **SO Strategies** (Maxi-Maxi) | **ST Strategies** (Maxi-Mini) |
| | Use strengths to capture opportunities | Use strengths to counter threats |
| **Weaknesses** | **WO Strategies** (Mini-Maxi) | **WT Strategies** (Mini-Mini) |
| | Overcome weaknesses to pursue opportunities | Minimize weaknesses to avoid threats |

**Strategy Types:**

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **SO (Maxi-Maxi)** | Offensive - Leverage strengths for opportunities | Strong brand (S) + Growing market (O) = Expand aggressively |
| **ST (Maxi-Mini)** | Defensive - Use strengths to mitigate threats | Tech expertise (S) + New competitor (T) = Innovate faster |
| **WO (Mini-Maxi)** | Investment - Fix weaknesses to seize opportunities | Limited capacity (W) + High demand (O) = Invest in expansion |
| **WT (Mini-Mini)** | Survival - Reduce exposure | Cash constraints (W) + Economic downturn (T) = Cut costs, preserve cash |

### Step 7: Assign Ownership

**Each action needs:**
- Owner (single person accountable)
- Timeline (specific deadline)
- Resources (budget, people)
- Success metrics (how to measure)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **No clear objective** - Always define what decision SWOT informs
2. **Too many items** - Stick to 3-5 per quadrant (prioritize)
3. **Vague factors** - Be specific with metrics and evidence
4. **Confusing internal/external** - Strengths/Weaknesses are internal only
5. **Opportunities as goals** - Opportunities are external conditions, not your desired outcomes
6. **No TOWS conversion** - SWOT without action is academic exercise
7. **Single perspective** - Get cross-functional input
8. **One-time snapshot** - Update regularly as conditions change
9. **Ignoring weaknesses** - Be honest about limitations
10. **Overweighting strengths** - Challenge each strength for validity
11. **Treating threats equally** - Prioritize by likelihood × impact
12. **No ownership** - Every action needs a single owner

## Common Misclassifications

| Item | Wrong Category | Right Category | Why |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| High employee turnover | Threat | Weakness | It's internal (your employees) |
| New competitor enters market | Weakness | Threat | It's external (market event) |
| "We should expand internationally" | Opportunity | Goal/Action | Opportunity is the market condition enabling this |
| Poor brand awareness | Opportunity | Weakness | It's a current limitation, not external condition |
| Growing market demand | Strength | Opportunity | It's external market condition |

## When to Use SWOT

- Starting strategic planning process
- Quick situational assessment
- New opportunity evaluation
- Annual planning kickoff
- Before major decisions
- Team alignment sessions

## When to Use Something Else

- Deep industry analysis → Porter's Five Forces
- Portfolio allocation → BCG Matrix
- Organizational change → McKinsey 7S
- Quantitative analysis → Financial modeling
- Competitive positioning → Perceptual mapping

## Tips for Facilitation

1. **Use silent brainstorming first** - Avoid groupthink
2. **Challenge each item** - "Is this really true?" "Can we prove it?"
3. **Force prioritization** - Vote, then discuss
4. **Connect to objective** - "How does this affect our decision?"
5. **Avoid solution mode early** - Analysis before action
6. **Document everything** - Capture for future reference
7. **Time-box each quadrant** - Prevent one section from dominating
