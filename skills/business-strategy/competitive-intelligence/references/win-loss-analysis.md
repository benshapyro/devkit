# Win/Loss Analysis Guide

Systematic methodology for learning from deal outcomes to improve competitive position.

## Overview

Win/loss analysis captures buyer feedback after purchase decisions to understand:
- Why customers chose you (or didn't)
- How competitors are perceived
- What drives buying decisions
- Where to improve product, positioning, or sales process

## Interview Methodology

### Timing

| Timing | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| 1-2 weeks post-decision | Fresh memory | May not have implementation experience |
| 2-4 weeks post-decision (Recommended) | Balance of memory + perspective | Some details may fade |
| 6+ weeks | Implementation insights | Decision rationale forgotten |

### Interviewer Selection

**Use Neutral Interviewer (Recommended):**
- Third-party research firm
- Internal team not involved in deal
- Customer success (for wins)

**Why Not the Sales Rep:**
- Buyers more honest with neutral party
- Rep may unconsciously lead answers
- Buyer may not want to hurt relationship
- Rep biased by their experience

### Interview Format

**Structure:**
- Duration: 20-30 minutes
- Format: Video call preferred (read body language)
- Recording: Ask permission to record for internal use
- Questions: Maximum 10 (respect buyer's time)

**Preparation:**
1. Review CRM data and deal history
2. Know which competitors were in evaluation
3. Understand deal size, timeline, key stakeholders
4. Prepare 3 custom questions based on deal specifics

## Best Practices

### Do
- Interview both wins AND losses (losses often more valuable)
- Use neutral interviewer when possible
- Ask open-ended questions, then probe deeper
- Record and transcribe (with permission)
- Tag consistently for trend analysis
- Close the loop (tell teams what changed because of their input)

### Don't
- Ask leading questions ("We're better on X, right?")
- Accept surface-level answers ("They were just cheaper")
- Only interview happy customers
- Let interviews go longer than 30 minutes
- Wait too long after decision (memory fades)
- Skip the "why" follow-up questions

### Common Interview Mistakes

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Was price a factor?" (yes/no) | "How did pricing factor into your decision?" (open) |
| "We're better on support, right?" | "How did you evaluate support across options?" |
| Accepting "They were cheaper" | "What made their price feel more appropriate?" |
| Skipping competitor questions | Always ask what they liked about competitors |
