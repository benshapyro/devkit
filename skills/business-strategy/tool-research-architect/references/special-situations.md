# Special Situations in Tool Research

## Overview

Not all tools fit neatly into the standard research framework. This guide helps you handle edge cases, ambiguous situations, and unusual tool configurations with clarity and professionalism.

## Situation 1: Limited Information Available

### When This Happens

- Tool is very new (launched <6 months ago)
- Small or private company with minimal public presence
- Enterprise-only tool with NDA-protected information
- Tool in beta or private testing phase
- Startup in stealth mode
- Tool primarily serves non-English markets

### How to Handle

**Be transparent about limitations rather than speculating:**

```markdown
## NewTool Beta

**Description:** NewTool is an AI-powered workflow automation platform (limited details available as tool is in private beta).

**Primary Use Case:** Appears to focus on document processing automation based on available information, but full capabilities not yet publicly disclosed.

**Secondary Use Cases:**
- Specific features not yet announced
- Public launch expected Q1 2026 per company blog

**Pricing Model:** Not yet announced (as of November 2025)
- Currently in invite-only beta
- No public pricing information available
- Company indicated freemium model planned for general availability

**LLM Connection:**
- **All Platforms:** Information not yet available - Tool in private beta

**Note:** This tool is new with very limited public information. Research based on company website and press release dated October 2025. Details will be updated when generally available.

**Sources:**
- Company website: newtool.com
- TechCrunch announcement: October 15, 2025
```

### Research Strategy

**1. Official sources first:**
- Company website and blog
- Official Twitter/LinkedIn announcements
- Press releases
- Company executives' social media

**2. Limited third-party:**
- Recent tech news coverage (TechCrunch, VentureBeat)
- Product Hunt launch page
- Investor announcements

**3. What NOT to do:**
- Don't guess features based on similar tools
- Don't extrapolate pricing from competitors
- Don't assume capabilities without evidence
- Don't mix up company promises with delivered features

**4. Document what you know and don't know:**
- "Information not publicly available"
- "Estimated based on company announcement"
- "To be announced"
- "Confirmed features: X, Y. Unconfirmed: Z"

### Red Flags for Speculation

Avoid phrases like:
- "Likely includes..."
- "Probably supports..."
- "Should offer..."
- "Expected to have..."

Use instead:
- "Not yet announced"
- "Information unavailable as of [date]"
- "Company has not disclosed..."
- "Details pending public release"

## Situation 2: Related Tools (Mergers, Acquisitions, Rebrands)

### When This Happens

- Company A acquires Company B's tool
- Tool X rebrands to Tool Y
- Two tools merge into one product
- Legacy name still widely used in market
- Parent company changes but product name stays

### How to Handle: Clarify Relationship Immediately

#### Scenario A: Recent Acquisition (Both Still Active)

```markdown
## Figma

**Acquisition Note:** Figma was acquired by Adobe in September 2022 for $20 billion. As of November 2025, Figma continues to operate independently with its own branding, product development, and pricing.

**Description:** Figma is a collaborative design tool where teams create and review interfaces together in real-time, like Google Docs for designers.

```

#### Scenario B: Rebrand (Old Name Deprecated)

```markdown
## Twilio Segment

**Formerly:** Segment (rebranded to Twilio Segment in November 2020 following acquisition)

**Note:** All current documentation uses "Twilio Segment." The name "Segment" alone is legacy and may cause confusion. The product is now fully integrated into Twilio's platform.

**Description:** Twilio Segment collects customer data from websites and apps and routes it to marketing and analytics tools.

[Continue with standard sections...]
```

#### Scenario C: Merger (Two Become One)

```markdown
## Salesforce Marketing Cloud

**Merger Background:** Salesforce Marketing Cloud is the result of integrating ExactTarget (acquired 2013), Pardot (acquired 2013), and several other marketing tools into one platform. Legacy users of these individual tools are now on the unified Marketing Cloud.

**Important:** If researching ExactTarget or Pardot specifically, note they are now part of Marketing Cloud and no longer standalone products.

**Description:** Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps businesses send personalized marketing messages across email, social media, mobile, and advertising channels.

```

#### Scenario D: Legacy Product References

```markdown
## Google Workspace

**Formerly:** G Suite (rebranded to Google Workspace in October 2020)

**Historical Note:** Prior to 2016, various Google business tools had separate names (Google Apps for Work, Google Apps for Business). If researching these legacy names, redirect to Google Workspace.

**Description:** Google Workspace combines Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, and other Google tools into one business productivity suite.

[Continue with standard sections...]
```

#### Scenario E: Sunsetting with Migration Path

```markdown
## Tool X

**Status:** Being discontinued and replaced by Tool Y (sunset announced March 2025, complete by December 2025)

**Migration:** Existing Tool X customers are being automatically migrated to Tool Y. New signups are directed to Tool Y immediately.

**This Profile:** Documents Tool X for historical context and existing users. For new implementations, see Tool Y profile.

```

### Research Checklist for Related Tools

Before documenting:
- [ ] Confirmed which name is current
- [ ] Verified relationship type (acquisition/rebrand/merger)
- [ ] Noted date of change
- [ ] Clarified if both products are still active
- [ ] Explained migration path if relevant
- [ ] Checked if pricing changed due to relationship
- [ ] Verified if features were added/removed
- [ ] Noted any legacy customers on old plans

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Acquisition + Separate Operation**
- Example: LinkedIn by Microsoft
- Status: Acquired but operates independently
- Treatment: Note acquisition, document current state

**Pattern 2: Acquisition + Full Integration**
- Example: Instagram by Meta/Facebook
- Status: Fully integrated into parent ecosystem
- Treatment: Note relationship, explain how they work together

**Pattern 3: Rebrand Same Product**
- Example: Google Apps → G Suite → Google Workspace
- Status: Same product, new name
- Treatment: Note all historical names, use current one

**Pattern 4: Merge Multiple Products**
- Example: HubSpot Marketing + Sales + Service Hub
- Status: Multiple products now one platform
- Treatment: Explain what merged, document unified offering

## Situation 3: Multiple Products from One Company

### When This Happens

- Company offers product family or suite
- Multiple related but distinct products
- Products have overlapping features
- Different products for different markets/audiences
- Modular products that can be combined

### How to Handle

#### Option A: Focus on Core Product with Note

Best for: Clear flagship product, others are extensions

```markdown
## HubSpot

**Product Family Note:** HubSpot offers multiple integrated products:
- **HubSpot Marketing Hub:** Marketing automation (focus of this profile)
- **HubSpot Sales Hub:** Sales CRM
- **HubSpot Service Hub:** Customer service
- **HubSpot CMS Hub:** Website content management

This profile focuses on Marketing Hub, their original and most popular product. Pricing shown is for Marketing Hub only.

**Description:** HubSpot Marketing Hub helps businesses attract visitors, convert leads, and measure marketing performance through email marketing, social media, and content tools.

### Decision Tree: Which Product to Document

```
Does company have clear flagship product?
├─ Yes → Document flagship, note others exist
└─ No → Continue

Are products equally important/popular?
├─ Yes → Document all with structure
└─ No → Continue

Are products for different audiences?
├─ Yes → Document by use case or document all
└─ No → Continue

Is the request ambiguous?
├─ Yes → Ask user which specific product to research
└─ No → Document the specific product requested
```

## Situation 4: Complex or Unusual Pricing Models

### When This Happens

- Pricing varies significantly by deployment method
- Multiple pricing dimensions (users + usage + features)
- Regional pricing with substantial differences
- Add-on costs that significantly impact total price
- Custom pricing only with no ballpark figures
- Hybrid models combining multiple pricing types

### How to Handle

#### Complex: Multiple Deployment Options

```markdown
**Pricing Model:** Multiple pricing structures depending on deployment

**Cloud (SaaS):**
- Starter: $50/month for 5 users
- Professional: $200/month for 20 users
- Enterprise: $1,000/month for 100 users

**Self-Hosted (On-Premise):**
- Software license: $5,000 one-time per 10-user pack
- Annual maintenance: 20% of license cost ($1,000/year)
- Implementation services: $10,000-$50,000 (varies by complexity)

**Hybrid (Cloud + On-Premise):**
- Base cloud platform: $500/month
- On-premise data storage: $15,000 one-time + $3,000/year maintenance

**Total Cost of Ownership Example (50 users, 3 years):**
- Cloud: $36,000 (simple, predictable)
- Self-Hosted: $55,000-$100,000 (higher upfront, more control)
- Hybrid: $38,000 (middle ground)

*(Pricing verified November 2025)*
```

#### Complex: Multi-Dimensional Pricing

```markdown
**Pricing Model:** Usage-based with multiple dimensions

**Dimensions:**
1. Seats (users who can access the platform)
2. Data volume (records or GB stored)
3. API calls (integrations and automations)

**Example Calculations:**

**Small Team (5 users, 10k records, 50k API calls/month):**
- Seats: 5 × $20 = $100
- Data: 10k records included free
- API: 50k calls included free
- **Total: $100/month**

**Medium Team (25 users, 100k records, 500k API calls/month):**
- Seats: 25 × $20 = $500
- Data: $50 for 90k records over base 10k
- API: $100 for 400k calls over base 100k
- **Total: $650/month**

**Enterprise (100 users, 1M records, 5M API calls/month):**
- Custom pricing - estimated $3,000-$5,000/month
- Volume discounts available
- Annual contract required

*(Pricing verified November 2025 from official calculator)*
```

#### Complex: Platform + Add-Ons

```markdown
**Pricing Model:** Base platform + à la carte add-ons

**Base Platform (Required):**
- Starter: $50/month - 5 users, core features
- Professional: $200/month - 20 users, advanced features
- Enterprise: $500/month - Unlimited users, premium features

**Popular Add-Ons (Optional but commonly needed):**
- Advanced analytics: +$50/month
- Premium integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot): +$25/month each
- Extra storage (per 100GB): +$10/month
- White labeling: +$100/month
- Priority support: +$50/month

**Typical Total Cost:**
- Starter + 2 integrations + analytics = $125/month minimum
- Professional + full add-ons = $465/month realistic estimate
- Enterprise + full add-ons = $835/month typical

**Note:** Add-on costs can exceed base platform cost. Plan accordingly.

## Situation 5: Contradictory or Unclear Information

### When This Happens

- Different sources show different prices
- Feature lists don't match across sources
- Recent changes not reflected everywhere
- Regional variations cause confusion
- Promotional vs. standard pricing unclear
- Old information still ranking in search

### How to Handle: Document Discrepancies Transparently

```markdown
**Pricing Model:** Per-user subscription (Note: some sources show outdated pricing)

**Official Current Pricing (domain.com/pricing, verified November 23, 2025):**
- Professional: $25/user/month (monthly) or $20/user/month (annual)
- Enterprise: $50/user/month (monthly) or $40/user/month (annual)

**Note on pricing variations found during research:**
- G2 and Capterra show $15/user for Professional tier - this is outdated (pre-October 2024 price increase)
- Some Reddit discussions mention $18/user - this may be grandfathered pricing for existing customers
- TechCrunch article from June 2024 cites $20/user - accurate at that time but since updated

**Always verify:** Current pricing at domain.com/pricing (last updated October 15, 2024 per site footer)

*(Research conducted and verified November 23, 2025)*
```

### Resolution Priority Hierarchy

1. **Official company website** (current, not cached)
2. **Official documentation** (current version)
3. **Recent company blog posts** (within 3 months)
4. **Recent press releases**
5. **Recent third-party news** (within 3 months)
6. **Third-party databases** (noted as potentially outdated)

### Phrases for Handling Uncertainty

**When pricing conflicts:**
- "Official site shows X, but Y source shows Z - official site is most current"
- "Multiple prices found - verified X from official source dated [date]"

**When features are unclear:**
- "Feature availability could not be definitively confirmed"
- "Official docs do not clearly state whether X is included"

**When information is dated:**
- "Most recent official information is from [date], may not reflect current state"
- "No updates found since [date], pricing may have changed"

## Situation 6: Tool No Longer Available

### When This Happens

- Product discontinued or end-of-life announced
- Company shut down or acquired and shuttered
- Product replaced by next version
- Sunset announced with migration deadline
- Service has already ended

### How to Handle

```markdown

```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is information very limited?
├─ Yes → Use "Limited Information" pattern + document what you know
└─ No → Continue

Are there related tools (merger/rebrand)?
├─ Yes → Clarify relationship immediately in prominent note
└─ No → Continue

Multiple products from one company?
├─ Yes → Choose Option A (focus), B (document all), or C (use case)
└─ No → Continue

Pricing complex or contradictory?
├─ Yes → Structure clearly, document discrepancies with dates
└─ No → Continue

Tool discontinued?
├─ Yes → Mark clearly, provide alternatives, note migration path
└─ No → Standard research framework applies
```

## General Principles for All Special Situations

1. **Transparency beats speculation:** Better to say "not available" than guess
2. **Date everything:** Especially important for changing situations
3. **Provide context:** Help reader understand why information is limited
4. **Note what you know and don't know:** Be explicit about boundaries
5. **Document your research:** List sources, dates checked
6. **Offer alternatives when relevant:** Especially for discontinued tools
7. **Use clear formatting:** Make special situations stand out visually
8. **Update regularly:** Note when profile should be re-checked

## Final Reminder

Special situations require extra care but also provide extra value. Clients appreciate thorough research that acknowledges complexity rather than oversimplifying it. Your job is to present the truth clearly, not to make every tool look perfect.

**When in doubt:**
- Be honest about limitations
- Date all information
- Cite your sources
- Mark uncertainty clearly
- Provide context
- Offer alternatives when appropriate
