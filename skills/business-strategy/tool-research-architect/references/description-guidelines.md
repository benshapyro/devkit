# Description Guidelines

## Overview

Tool descriptions should be clear, concise, and accessible to non-technical business people. This guide helps you write descriptions that executives and decision-makers can immediately understand.

## The "3 L's" Rule

Great descriptions are:

1. **Lucid** - Crystal clear, no confusion about what the tool does
2. **Lean** - 1-3 sentences maximum, no fluff
3. **Layman** - Understandable to non-technical readers

If your description fails any of these three tests, revise it.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Plain English Only

Replace technical jargon with everyday language.

**❌ Technical jargon:**
"Asynchronous task queue with distributed worker architecture enabling horizontal scalability"

**✓ Plain English:**
"Helps your systems handle background tasks like sending emails or processing files without slowing down your main application"

**Why this matters:** Most decision-makers are business people, not engineers. They need to understand value, not architecture.

### Principle 2: Use Analogies

Connect unfamiliar tools to familiar concepts.

**❌ Abstract:**
"Provides containerized deployment orchestration across distributed infrastructure"

**✓ Analogy:**
"Like a traffic controller for your software - automatically directs different parts of your application to run on different servers as needed"

**Good analogy sources:**
- Physical objects ("like a filing cabinet")
- Common software ("like Google Docs but...")
- Real-world roles ("like a traffic controller")
- Household items ("like a thermostat for...")

### Principle 3: Focus on the Job-to-be-Done

Emphasize outcomes, not features.

**❌ Feature-focused:**
"Offers real-time collaboration, version control, document management, and commenting capabilities"

**✓ Job-focused:**
"Lets teams write, edit, and organize documents together in real-time, like Google Docs but with more structure and control for companies"

**Ask yourself:** What problem does someone hire this tool to solve?

### Principle 4: Write for Executives, Not Engineers

Assume your audience:
- Understands business concepts (ROI, efficiency, productivity)
- May not understand technical concepts (APIs, databases, servers)
- Cares about outcomes (save time, reduce costs, improve quality)
- Doesn't care about implementation details (how it works technically)

## Template Patterns

Use these proven patterns as starting points.

### Pattern 1: The Analogy Bridge

**Structure:**
```
[Tool] is like [familiar thing], but for [specific use case].
[Key differentiator in simple terms].
```

**Example 1:**
"Notion is like a digital workspace that combines notes, databases, and wikis. It lets teams organize everything from meeting notes to project roadmaps in one place using simple building blocks."

**Example 2:**
"Figma is like Google Docs for designers - multiple people can work on the same design simultaneously, eliminating version control headaches."

**When to use:** When the tool is similar to something people already know.

### Pattern 2: The Problem → Solution

**Structure:**
```
[Tool] solves [specific problem] by [how it works in simple terms].
[Who uses it and why].
```

**Example 1:**
"Zapier automates repetitive work between your apps—like automatically saving email attachments to Dropbox or adding form responses to spreadsheets. It's designed for people who want automation without writing code."

**Example 2:**
"Calendly eliminates email back-and-forth when scheduling meetings by letting people book directly from your available times. Popular with sales teams and anyone who schedules many external meetings."

**When to use:** When the tool solves an obvious pain point.

### Pattern 3: The Positioning Statement

**Structure:**
```
[Tool] is a [category] that helps [audience] [primary benefit].
[What makes it different].
```

**Example 1:**
"Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid that helps teams track projects, manage inventory, or organize any kind of information. It looks like a spreadsheet but works like a database, with more flexibility than Excel but simpler than traditional databases."

**Example 2:**
"Slack replaces email for team conversations, organizing discussions into channels by project or topic. Messages are searchable, and teams can quickly loop in the right people when needed."

**When to use:** When the tool fits a recognizable category with a twist.

### Pattern 4: The Transformation

**Structure:**
```
[Tool] transforms [complex thing] into [simple thing].
[What this enables].
```

**Example 1:**
"Looker turns your company's raw data into visual reports and dashboards that business teams can explore without needing technical skills—like giving everyone a simplified version of a data analyst."

**Example 2:**
"Canva makes graphic design accessible to non-designers by providing templates and drag-and-drop tools. Anyone can create professional-looking social media posts, presentations, or marketing materials."

**When to use:** When the tool democratizes something complex.

## Common Jargon to Avoid

Learn to recognize and replace technical terms:

| ❌ Don't Say | ✓ Say Instead |
|-------------|--------------|
| "SaaS platform" | "Web-based tool" or "cloud software" |
| "API-first architecture" | "Built to connect easily with other tools" |
| "NoSQL database" | "Flexible database" |
| "Microservices" | "Modular system" |
| "Containerization" | "Packaged software components" |
| "Event-driven architecture" | "Responds automatically to actions" |
| "Serverless computing" | "Automatically scales without managing servers" |
| "ETL pipeline" | "Moves and transforms data between systems" |
| "Real-time synchronization" | "Updates instantly across devices" |
| "Machine learning algorithms" | "AI-powered predictions" or "learns from patterns" |
| "REST API" | "Connection to other tools" |
| "Low-code/no-code" | "Build things without programming" |
| "Enterprise-grade security" | "Bank-level security" |
| "Webhooks" | "Automatic notifications between apps" |
| "Single sign-on (SSO)" | "Log in once, access all tools" |

## Examples: Good vs. Bad

Learn from these before/after examples.

### Example 1: Project Management Tool

**❌ Bad (jargon-heavy):**
"Agile project management platform with sprint planning, kanban boards, and burn-down charts for distributed development teams."

**✓ Good (clear and accessible):**
"Jira helps software teams plan and track their work using visual boards. Teams can see what everyone is working on, what's done, and what's coming next—popular with engineering teams building software."

**Why it's better:** Removed "Agile," "sprint," "kanban," and "burn-down" - explains value instead.

### Example 2: Data Analytics Tool

**❌ Bad (too technical):**
"Business intelligence solution with SQL-based querying, data visualization, and embedded analytics capabilities."

**✓ Good (outcome-focused):**
"Looker turns your company's raw data into visual reports and dashboards. Business teams can explore data and answer questions without needing technical skills—like having a data analyst on demand."

**Why it's better:** Focuses on what users can do, not how the technology works.

### Example 3: Communication Tool

**❌ Bad (just features):**
"Unified communications platform with channels, threads, file sharing, video calls, and third-party integrations."

**✓ Good (job-to-be-done):**
"Slack replaces email for team conversations, organizing discussions into channels by project or topic. Messages are searchable, and teams can quickly loop in the right people when needed."

**Why it's better:** Explains the problem it solves (email overload) and the outcome (organized, searchable conversations).

### Example 4: Payment Processing

**❌ Bad (technical details):**
"Payment gateway with PCI-compliant tokenization, recurring billing engine, and webhook-based event notifications."

**✓ Good (business value):**
"Stripe handles online payments for businesses—from processing credit cards to managing subscriptions. It's designed for developers who want to add payment features to websites or apps without dealing with banking complexities."

**Why it's better:** Explains what it does and who it's for in everyday language.

### Example 5: Design Tool

**❌ Bad (feature list):**
"Vector-based design tool with real-time collaboration, prototyping, design systems, and developer handoff capabilities."

**✓ Good (analogy + value):**
"Figma is a collaborative design tool where teams create and review interfaces together in real-time, like Google Docs for designers. Multiple people can work on the same design simultaneously."

**Why it's better:** Uses a familiar analogy and highlights the key innovation (real-time collaboration).

## The "Grandmother Test"

Before finalizing any description, ask yourself:

**"Could I explain this to my grandmother over the phone?"**

If the answer is no:
- Remove technical terms
- Add concrete examples or analogies
- Focus on the outcome, not the technology
- Use everyday language

If you need to use a technical term, immediately explain it:
```
"Salesforce is a customer relationship management (CRM) system—software that helps sales teams track potential customers and manage relationships."
```

## Length Guidelines

**Target:** 1-2 sentences (25-50 words)  
**Maximum:** 3 sentences (75 words)

**Why this matters:** Descriptions should quickly establish what the tool does. Deep detail belongs in use cases and other sections.

**Sentence breakdown:**
- **Sentence 1:** What it does + how (include analogy or simple explanation)
- **Sentence 2 (optional):** Who uses it and why OR what makes it different from alternatives
- **Sentence 3 (rarely):** Additional context only if essential

**Test:** If you can't say your description out loud in one breath, it's too long.

## Formula for Each Sentence Type

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Writing Marketing Copy

**Problem:** "Revolutionary AI-powered platform transforms how teams collaborate"

**Fix:** "Slack replaces email for team conversations, organizing discussions into channels by topic"

**Why:** Remove superlatives and focus on concrete functionality.

### Mistake 2: Assuming Technical Knowledge

**Problem:** "RESTful API for CRUD operations with OAuth authentication"

**Fix:** "Provides a connection that lets other apps read and update your data securely"

**Why:** Translate technical concepts to outcomes.

### Mistake 3: Listing Features Instead of Benefits

**Problem:** "Includes dashboards, reports, filters, and exports"

**Fix:** "Helps you visualize data and answer business questions without technical skills"

**Why:** Features are means, benefits are ends. Focus on ends.

### Mistake 4: Being Too Vague

**Problem:** "A powerful platform for managing your work"

**Fix:** "Helps software teams track bugs, plan features, and manage releases"

**Why:** Specificity helps readers understand if it's relevant to them.

### Mistake 5: Using Industry Jargon

**Problem:** "Omnichannel customer engagement platform with ML-driven personalization"

**Fix:** "Sends personalized marketing messages to customers across email, text, and social media based on their behavior"

**Why:** Industry terms create barriers. Plain language opens doors.

## Final Pro Tips

1. **Read it out loud:** If you stumble, so will your readers. Rewrite.

2. **Get a second opinion:** Ask someone not in your industry if they understand it.

3. **Start with "This tool helps...":** Then finish the sentence. This forces clarity.

4. **Use active voice:** "Helps teams track" not "Can be used by teams for tracking"

5. **Be concrete:** "Manages invoices and expenses" not "Handles financial operations"

6. **Compare wisely:** If you say "like X," make sure X is widely known

7. **One idea per sentence:** Don't cram everything into one run-on sentence

8. **Cut filler words:** "Basically," "essentially," "actually" - delete them

Remember: **The best description is the one that makes someone immediately understand what the tool does and whether they might need it.** Everything else is noise.
