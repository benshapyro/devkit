# Context-Specific Presentation Adaptations

## Virtual Presentations

**Unique challenges**: Smaller screens, limited non-verbal feedback, easier to disengage, technical issues

**Optimizations**:
- Increase slide count by 20% (faster pacing maintains attention)
- Engagement element every 3-4 slides (poll, question, chat prompt)
- Larger fonts (assume 13-15" laptops): Minimum 28pt body, 48pt titles
- More annotations (no laser pointer available)
- Progress indicators on every slide (X of Y, timeline)
- Simplified visuals (details get lost on small screens)

**Technical preparations**:
- Test screen sharing beforehand
- Have PDF backup ready
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use presenter view for notes
- Have phone number for audio backup

**Engagement tactics**:
- Name participants when responding
- Use chat for questions throughout
- Share slides in advance (reduces note-taking cognitive load)
- Take breaks every 25-30 minutes
- Use reaction features (polls, emoji responses)

## High-Stakes Presentations

**Contexts**: Board meetings, investor pitches, C-suite decisions, major sales

**Pre-presentation**:
- Send pre-read 48 hours ahead (allows cognitive processing)
- Schedule 30-minute prep call to align on objectives
- Understand decision criteria and key objections
- Prepare 3x backup slides versus main deck
- Practice with similar audience profile (murder board)

**Structure**:
- Lead with recommendation (primacy effect, respect their time)
- Position critical ask in recency zone (last 20%)
- Use Pyramid Principle framework
- Financial implications on slide 2-3
- Risk mitigation addressed upfront

**Visual style**:
- Authority colors (black, dark blue, gray)
- McKinsey style: Logic-driven, analytical
- Conservative design (no experimental layouts)
- Data-rich but not cluttered
- Professional photography only (no cartoons/casual images)

**Delivery**:
- Arrive 30 minutes early
- Test all tech twice
- Have printed backup
- Know your opening 2 minutes cold
- Prepared for interruptions (welcome them)

**Q&A preparation**:
- Anticipate top 10 questions
- Create backup slides for each
- Number backup slides for quick reference
- Practice bridging back to key messages
- Know when to offer offline follow-up

## Time-Compressed Situations

**Contexts**: Last-minute meetings, schedule overruns, elevator pitches

**Structure requirements**:
- Pyramid Principle mandatory (recommendation first)
- Maximum 3 key points total
- No builds/animations (immediate visibility)
- Details in appendix only

**<10 minutes**:
- 5-7 slides maximum
- Executive summary + 3 supporting points + CTA
- Focus entirely on primacy and recency zones
- Skip all middle content
- Verbal delivery of details, not on slides

**<5 minutes**:
- 3 slides: Problem, Solution, Ask
- One key data point per slide
- Practice at 45 seconds per slide
- Have 30-second version ready

**Adaptation on-the-fly**:
- Know which slides are mandatory (mark in deck)
- Can skip any slide that isn't critical path
- Jump directly to backup if specific question asked
- Use progressive disclosure: "Happy to go deeper on any area"

**Leave-behind**:
- Comprehensive deck with all details
- Exec summary at front (they may only read this)
- Your contact info prominent
- Clear next steps and timeline

## Mixed Audience (Technical + Executive)

**Challenge**: Different knowledge levels, different interests, different decision criteria

**Structure approach**:
- Executive summary optimized for executives (first 5 slides)
- "How it works" section for technical (slides 6-15)
- "Why it matters" business case (slides 16-20)
- Deep technical specs in appendix

**Layered information**:
- Start with high-level business value
- Progressively add technical detail
- Provide analogies for non-technical
- Technical specifications in footnotes/appendix

**Slide design**:
- Hybrid layout: Visual primary, technical details in sidebar
- Glossary provided upfront or in appendix
- Use both abstract frameworks AND concrete examples
- Color-code: Blue for business, Green for technical, Red for risks

**Delivery tactics**:
- Address executives first (they're decision makers)
- "For those interested in the technical details..." transitions
- Invite technical questions for offline or appendix
- Bridge technical points to business impact

**Separate tracks option**:
- If possible, two sessions: Executive briefing + Technical deep-dive
- Or: Presentation with optional technical breakout after
- Provide different leave-behinds for each audience

## Crisis Communication Presentations

**Contexts**: Incident response, bad news delivery, damage control

**Structure**:
- What happened (facts only, no speculation)
- Current status and impact
- Immediate actions taken
- Path forward and timeline
- How we'll prevent recurrence

**Tone**:
- Serious but not panicked
- Transparent about what we know and don't know
- Accountable without making excuses
- Forward-looking after establishing facts

**Visual approach**:
- Timeline of events (establishes clarity)
- Status dashboard (current state)
- Action plan with ownership
- Minimal decoration (respect severity)
- Red for problems, Yellow for in-progress, Green for resolved

**Communication principles**:
- No surprises (send key info before if possible)
- Acknowledge emotions (theirs and yours)
- Provide forum for questions
- Commit to follow-up timeline
- Document everything

## Sales and Demo Presentations

**Framework**: Problem → Solution → ROI → CTA

**Structure**:
- Open with customer pain (theirs specifically, not generic)
- Demo solution addressing that exact pain
- Show ROI calculation with their numbers
- Clear CTA with timeline

**Optimizations**:
- Customer proof points spaced throughout (3 total)
- Live demo in middle (cognitive break, proof)
- ROI calculator interactive if possible
- Comparison table (vs. competitors, positioned favorably)
- Overcome objections slide in backup

**Visual style**:
- BCG approach: Visual-led, dynamic
- Before/after comparisons
- Customer logos (with permission)
- Graphs showing improvement
- Green for benefits, Blue for trust

**Delivery**:
- Customize for their industry/role
- Use their terminology
- Reference their specific challenges
- Tell success stories similar to their situation
- Always be closing (CTA on multiple slides)

## Training and Workshop Presentations

**Framework**: NEURO Method or TED 4-Step

**Unique requirements**:
- Learning objectives stated upfront (primacy)
- Retrieval practice every 15 minutes
- Hands-on exercises (move from passive to active)
- Summaries at multiple points (aid retention)
- Takeaway document with resources

**Cognitive break requirements**:
- Every 10 minutes: Quick knowledge check
- Every 20 minutes: Partner discussion or exercise
- Every 40 minutes: Stand and stretch

**Slide design**:
- Yellow highlights for key concepts (memory boost)
- Step-by-step instructions clear and numbered
- Examples for each concept
- Practice problems with solutions in backup

**Materials**:
- Workbook or worksheet for exercises
- Reference guide for later use
- Links to additional resources
- Assessment or quiz (validates learning)

**Delivery**:
- Interactive throughout
- Check for understanding frequently
- Repeat key concepts 3+ times
- Different modalities (visual, verbal, kinesthetic)
- Encourage questions as they arise
