# Visual Design System Reference

## Layout Patterns

### F-Pattern Layout (Text-Heavy Content)
**Usage**: Lists, frameworks, analytical content, text-dominant slides
**Eye movement**: Horizontal at top → shorter horizontal scan → vertical down left
**Statistics**: 69% of viewing time on left side
**Implementation**:
- Place most critical info top-left
- First words of each bullet point are most important
- Decrease text length moving down page
- Left-align all text
- Use consistent left margin

### Z-Pattern Layout (Visual-Dominant)
**Usage**: Data visualizations, image-led slides, marketing content
**Eye movement**: Top-left → top-right → diagonal → bottom-left → bottom-right
**Implementation**:
- Logo/title top-left
- Call-to-action top-right
- Main visual center
- Supporting point bottom-left
- Next step bottom-right

## Color Psychology

### Decision-Making Colors

**Red** - Heightened Attention to Detail
- Effect: Increases focus on specifics, analytical thinking
- Use for: Financial data, warnings, risk analysis, critical metrics
- Avoid for: Creative brainstorming, big-picture strategy
- 60-30-10 application: 10% accent only (too stimulating as dominant)

**Blue** - Enhanced Creativity & Trust
- Effect: Promotes strategic thinking, openness to ideas
- Use for: Strategy sessions, planning, vision, brand trust
- Avoid for: Urgent warnings, immediate action items
- 60-30-10 application: 60% dominant for strategy presentations

**Yellow/Gold** - Memory Boost
- Effect: 55-78% retention increase for highlighted concepts
- Use for: Key concepts to remember, learning objectives, takeaways
- Avoid for: Body text (eye strain), excessive use (loses impact)
- 60-30-10 application: 10% accent for highlights only

**Green** - Positive Association & Growth
- Effect: Creates sense of progress, health, go-ahead
- Use for: Success metrics, growth indicators, positive outcomes
- Avoid for: Warnings, problems, areas of concern
- 60-30-10 application: 30% secondary for positive data

**Black/Dark Blue** - Authority & Premium
- Effect: Conveys credibility, executive confidence, sophistication
- Use for: Board presentations, high-stakes pitches, premium positioning
- Avoid for: Creative workshops, casual settings
- 60-30-10 application: 60% dominant for executive audiences

### Color Application Rules
- Maximum 3-4 colors per presentation
- 60-30-10 ratio: 60% dominant, 30% secondary, 10% accent
- Semantic consistency: Same color = same meaning throughout
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (accessibility)
- Test in grayscale to ensure hierarchy works without color

## Typography System

### Hierarchy
- **Titles**: 40-44pt (action statement or headline)
- **Subtitles**: 32-36pt (secondary headline or section header)
- **Body**: 24-30pt (bullet points, key text - must be readable from back row)
- **Annotations**: 18-20pt (chart labels, callouts)
- **Footnotes**: 10-14pt (sources, disclaimers)

### Font Selection
- Maximum 2 font families per presentation
- Pair serif (tradition/authority) with sans-serif (modern/clarity)
- Or use single sans-serif family with weight variation
- Test readability on projected screen, not just computer

### Text Treatment
- **Bold**: For emphasis only (not entire paragraphs)
- **Italic**: Sparingly for quotes or subtle emphasis
- **UPPERCASE**: Headlines only (harder to read in body)
- **Sentence case**: More readable than title case for body

## Whitespace Management

### Minimum Requirements
- 30-40% of slide should be empty space
- 0.5 inch minimum margins on all sides
- Visual breathing room between elements
- Group related items with proximity

### Why Whitespace Matters
- Reduces cognitive load
- Improves comprehension by 20%
- Creates visual hierarchy
- Guides attention to key elements
- Prevents overwhelming feeling

## Chart Selection Matrix

| Objective | Best Chart | Cognitive Load | Key Rules |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Compare values | Bar chart | Low | Start axis at zero, sort logically |
| Show trends over time | Line graph | Low | Continuous data only, limit to 3-4 lines |
| Part-to-whole | Pie chart | Medium | Maximum 4 slices, label directly |
| Correlation | Scatter plot | High | Include trend line, mark outliers |
| Distribution | Histogram | Medium-High | Show median/mean, note spread |
| Flow/process | Sankey diagram | Medium | Left to right, highlight bottlenecks |
| Ranking | Ordered bar | Low | Sort descending, highlight top 3 |
| Comparison matrix | Heatmap | Medium | Use consistent scale, legend |

### Universal Chart Rules
1. One message per chart (title states the insight)
2. Remove chartjunk (3D effects, excessive gridlines, decorative elements)
3. Direct labeling > legends (reduces eye movement)
4. Highlight key insight with color/annotation
5. Always include units and source
6. Use color consistently (same meaning throughout deck)

## Slide Templates by Purpose

### Title Slide
- Compelling headline (not just topic name)
- Visual hook or striking image (60% of slide)
- Speaker credentials (if relevant)
- Date/location (only if relevant)
- Avoid: Generic stock photos, cluttered logos

### Content Slide - Data Focus
- Single dominant visualization (60% of space)
- Action title stating the insight
- 2-3 supporting metrics max in sidebar
- Annotation pointing to key finding
- Source in footer (small, unobtrusive)

### Content Slide - Conceptual
- Framework visualization center-stage
- 3-4 components maximum
- Icons to anchor each concept
- Example in each quadrant/component
- Progressive disclosure if complex

### Transition Slide
- Section header with visual break
- Progress indicator (e.g., "Part 2 of 3")
- Brief preview of what's coming
- Cognitive break opportunity

### Call-to-Action Slide
- Single, specific ask (large, bold)
- 3-4 numbered next steps
- Timeline with ownership
- Success metrics defined
- Contact information

## Visual Hierarchy Techniques

### Size
- Most important element = largest
- 3-4 distinct size levels maximum
- Use scale to show relative importance

### Color
- High contrast = high importance
- Consistent color = consistent meaning
- Use sparingly for maximum impact

### Position
- F-pattern: Top-left = most important
- Z-pattern: Corner positions = key elements
- Center = focal point for images

### Typography
- Bold = emphasis
- Size = hierarchy
- Consistent fonts = professionalism

### Whitespace
- More space around = more important
- Tight grouping = related items
- Isolation = special attention

## Accessibility Considerations

### Color Blindness
- Don't rely on color alone for meaning
- Use patterns, icons, or labels as backup
- Test with grayscale view
- Red-green combinations are most problematic

### Low Vision
- Minimum 24pt for body text
- High contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Avoid light text on light background
- Sans-serif fonts generally more readable

### Cognitive Accessibility
- One idea per slide
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent layout patterns
- Avoid flashing or rapid transitions

## Common Design Mistakes

**Too Much Text**
- Problem: Walls of text, small fonts
- Fix: 30 words maximum, split into multiple slides
- Result: 40% retention improvement

**Poor Contrast**
- Problem: Light gray text on white, busy backgrounds
- Fix: High contrast, simple backgrounds
- Result: Readability from back row

**Inconsistent Style**
- Problem: Random fonts/colors/layouts
- Fix: Template with consistent elements
- Result: Professional appearance, less distraction

**Chartjunk**
- Problem: 3D effects, excessive decoration, unnecessary gridlines
- Fix: Minimal design, remove non-data ink
- Result: Faster comprehension, clearer insights

**Multiple Competing Visuals**
- Problem: Several charts/images per slide
- Fix: One dominant visual per slide
- Result: Clear focal point, reduced cognitive load

**Ignoring Eye Patterns**
- Problem: Key info in bottom-right or buried
- Fix: Follow F or Z pattern, place critical info strategically
- Result: Audience actually sees important content
