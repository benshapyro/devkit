# Presentation Frameworks Reference

Complete guide to selecting and implementing the 5 core story architectures.

## Pyramid Principle (Executive/Consulting)

**When to use**: Board presentations, executive briefings, time-pressed stakeholders, decision-focused meetings

**Structure**:
```
Recommendation (Top of Pyramid)
├── Supporting Argument 1 (MECE)
│   ├── Evidence A
│   └── Evidence B
├── Supporting Argument 2 (MECE)
│   ├── Evidence C
│   └── Evidence D
└── Supporting Argument 3 (MECE)
    ├── Evidence E
    └── Evidence F
```

**Key principles**:
- Start with the answer (recommendation/conclusion)
- Group supporting points using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- Every slide has action title stating the insight
- Details in appendix, accessed only if questioned

**Example structure** (15 slides):
1. Executive summary: "We should acquire CompanyX for $50M"
2. Market opportunity validates $200M TAM
3. Strategic fit strengthens our core offering
4. Financial model shows 3.5x ROI in 24 months
5-7. Supporting analysis (market data, competitive position, synergies)
8-10. Implementation approach
11. Next steps and timeline
12-25. Backup slides (detailed financials, market research, risk analysis)

**Slide title examples**:
- "Digital channels drive 67% of Q3 revenue"
- "Customer acquisition cost decreased 23% vs. Q2"
- "Three market factors support expansion timing"

**McKinsey style notes**:
- Text-dominant with analytical frameworks
- F-pattern layout for reading
- Minimal decoration
- Single action title per slide (5-10 words)

## SCR Framework (Problem-Solving)

**When to use**: Business cases, project proposals, change initiatives, problem-solving presentations

**Structure**:
- **Situation**: Establish current state and context (neutral tone)
- **Complication**: Introduce problem/challenge creating urgency
- **Resolution**: Present recommended solution and path forward

**Timing allocation**:
- Situation: 20-25% of presentation
- Complication: 25-30% of presentation  
- Resolution: 45-50% of presentation

**Example structure** (20 slides):

**Situation (Slides 1-5)**:
1. Executive summary
2. Current business model and performance
3. Market context and position
4. Stakeholder landscape
5. Historical trajectory

**Complication (Slides 6-10)**:
6. Emerging challenge identified
7. Quantified business impact
8. Competitive threat analysis
9. Time sensitivity and risk
10. What happens if we don't act

**Resolution (Slides 11-20)**:
11. Recommended solution overview
12. Three-part implementation approach
13. Part 1: Immediate actions (0-3 months)
14. Part 2: Foundation building (3-6 months)
15. Part 3: Scale and optimize (6-12 months)
16. Resource requirements
17. Success metrics and KPIs
18. Risk mitigation strategies
19. Expected outcomes and ROI
20. Next steps and decision timeline

**Storytelling technique**:
- Situation uses calming blues/greens
- Complication uses attention-grabbing reds/oranges
- Resolution uses confident blues and successful greens

**BCG style notes**:
- Visual-led with data visualization first
- Two-line headlines (thematic label + specific insight)
- Z-pattern layout for visual flow
- Annotated charts tell the story

## Duarte's Resonate (Inspirational)

**When to use**: Keynotes, vision presentations, change leadership, organizational transformation

**Core concept**: Oscillate between "what is" (current reality) and "what could be" (aspirational future)

**Structure**:
```
Opening (What is + What could be contrast)
├── Section 1: What is (pain/limitation)
├── Section 1: What could be (possibility)
├── Section 2: What is (current barrier)
├── Section 2: What could be (overcome vision)
├── Section 3: What is (status quo)
├── Section 3: What could be (transformation)
└── Climax: New Bliss (transformed world)
```

**STAR Moment**: Something They'll Always Remember
- Position in primacy (first 20%) or recency (last 20%)
- Striking statistic, powerful story, dramatic demonstration
- Creates emotional peak in presentation

**Example structure** (30 minutes, ~25 slides):

**Opening (3 min, slides 1-3)**:
1. Hook: Striking contrast of current vs. possible
2. Stakes: Why this matters now
3. Journey preview: Where we're going together

**Body - Oscillating Pattern (20 min, slides 4-20)**:
4. What is: Manual processes consume 40% of time
5. What could be: Automation liberates teams for strategy
6. What is: Customer wait times average 48 hours
7. What could be: Real-time responses delight customers
8. What is: Data trapped in silos
9. What could be: Insights flow freely
...continue pattern...

**STAR Moment (slide 12)**: 
- Live demonstration of transformation
- Customer testimonial video
- Before/after dramatic reveal

**Climax (5 min, slides 21-23)**:
21. New bliss: The transformed world we'll create together
22. Call to adventure: Your role in this journey
23. First steps: How we begin tomorrow

**Backup (slides 24-35)**: Implementation details, FAQs, technical specs

**Presentation techniques**:
- Audience as hero (not you)
- You as mentor/guide
- Use contrast visually (split screen, before/after)
- Build emotional arc toward climax
- End with call to action

## TED 4-Step (Educational/Public Speaking)

**When to use**: Conference talks, thought leadership, public speaking, educational presentations

**Structure**:
1. **Hook** (30-60 seconds): Pattern interrupt that grabs attention
2. **Promise** (2-3 minutes): What they'll learn and why it matters
3. **Proof** (12-15 minutes): 2-3 main points with evidence
4. **Push** (2-3 minutes): Call to action

**Hook examples**:
- Provocative question: "What if everything you know about productivity is wrong?"
- Surprising statistic: "73% of you will forget this talk by tomorrow—unless..."
- Personal story: "I failed spectacularly. Here's what I learned."
- Demonstration: Immediate show-don't-tell moment

**Example structure** (18 minutes, ~15 slides):

**Hook (1 min, slide 1)**:
- Open with surprising fact or story
- No introduction, dive straight in
- Create curiosity gap

**Promise (2 min, slides 2-3)**:
2. What you'll learn today
3. Why this matters to you specifically

**Proof (12 min, slides 4-13)**:
*Point 1* (4 min, slides 4-6):
4. Main concept introduction
5. Supporting evidence/research
6. Real-world example

*Point 2* (4 min, slides 7-9):
7. Second concept builds on first
8. Data or case study
9. Demonstration or story

*Point 3* (4 min, slides 10-12):
10. Third concept completes framework
11. Integration of all concepts
12. Implications and applications

13. Summary: How these connect

**Push (3 min, slides 14-15)**:
14. Specific, actionable next step
15. Vision of transformed future + contact info

**TED techniques**:
- No bullet points (conversational, not corporate)
- Full-screen visuals with minimal text
- Stories and examples over abstract concepts
- Practice for naturalness, not perfection
- 3 main ideas maximum (working memory)

## NEURO Method (Science-Based Structure)

**When to use**: Complex information, data-heavy content, learning-focused presentations, technical topics

**NEURO Principles**:

**N - Numbers**: Maximum 3-4 chunks per slide (working memory limit)
- 3-4 bullet points maximum
- 3-4 key metrics per data slide
- 3-4 main sections in presentation

**E - Eye Path**: Design for natural scanning patterns
- F-pattern for text-heavy slides (top and left priority)
- Z-pattern for visual slides (diagonal flow)
- Guide attention with visual hierarchy

**U - Unity**: Synchronize visual and verbal channels
- Don't show text while reading different text (50% comprehension drop)
- Align what you say with what they see
- Remove conflicting information

**R - Repetition**: Space key messages 3x across presentation
- Introduction (primacy zone, first 20%)
- Example/application (middle, with cognitive break)
- Summary (recency zone, last 20%)

**O - Order**: Leverage serial position effects
- Primacy zone (first 20%): Most critical messages
- Danger zone (middle 60%): Requires cognitive breaks and repetition
- Recency zone (last 20%): Action items and CTAs

**Example structure** (30 slides, 45 minutes):

**Primacy Zone (slides 1-6, first 9 minutes)**:
1. Title with key message preview
2. Executive summary: 3 critical findings
3. Framework overview: 4 components max
4. Finding #1 (most important)

- Minute 10: Story/anecdote (30 seconds)
- Minute 20: Interactive poll (2 minutes)
- Minute 30: Video or demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Minute 40: Q&A preview (2 minutes)

**NEURO implementation checklist**:
- [ ] No slide exceeds 4 information chunks
- [ ] F or Z pattern applied to each slide
- [ ] Visual and verbal channels synchronized
- [ ] Key messages appear at minutes 5, 20, and 42 (3x repetition)

## Framework Selection Decision Tree

Use this logic to choose the optimal framework:

**1. What's your primary objective?**
- Decision → Continue to #2
- Inspiration → Use Duarte's Resonate
- Education → Continue to #3
- Analysis → Continue to #4

**2. Decision needed - How much time do you have?**
- <30 minutes → Use Pyramid Principle
- >30 minutes → Use SCR Framework

**3. Education needed - What's audience expertise?**
- Expert audience → Use NEURO Method
- Mixed/novice audience → Use TED 4-Step

**4. Analysis needed - Who's the stakeholder?**
- Board/investors/executives → Use Pyramid Principle (McKinsey style)
- Market/customers/general → Use SCR (BCG style)

**Multi-objective scenarios**:
- Decision + Inspiration → SCR with emotional hooks
- Education + Decision → NEURO Method with action-oriented close
- Analysis + Inspiration → Pyramid with "what could be" vision slides

**Time-constrained override**: 
- If <20 minutes regardless of objective → Use Pyramid Principle
- Start with recommendation, support with top 3 points only, backup for details

**Audience size consideration**:
- <10 people → Any framework, interactive
- 10-50 people → Pyramid, SCR, or NEURO
- 50-200 people → TED or Duarte
- 200+ people → TED or Duarte (inspirational only)
