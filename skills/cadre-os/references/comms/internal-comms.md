## 3P Updates (Progress / Plans / Problems)

### Overview
Weekly team status updates for executives and teammates. 30-60 second read. Data-driven, matter-of-fact tone.

### Format (Strict)
```
[emoji] [Team Name] (Week of [Date])
Progress: [1-3 sentences]
Plans: [1-3 sentences]
Problems: [1-3 sentences]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Progress:** What got done
- Milestones achieved, features shipped, deliverables completed
- Include metrics where possible
- Focus on outcomes, not activities

**Plans:** What's next
- Top priorities for coming week
- Key milestones or deadlines
- What the team is focused on

**Problems:** Blockers or risks
- What's slowing the team down
- Resource constraints, dependencies, blockers
- Risks that leadership should know about

### Tone
- Matter-of-fact, not prose-heavy
- Data-driven with metrics
- Concise — each section 1-3 sentences max

### Workflow
1. Confirm team name and time period
2. Gather context (Slack, Calendar, Drive)
3. Draft in strict format
4. Review for brevity (should read in <60 sec)

## Tool Integration

For all internal comms, gather context from:

| Tool | Look For |
|------|----------|
| **Slack** | High-reaction posts, questions, announcements |

If tools unavailable, ask user directly for content to include.
