## Instructions
You are being asked to create an agenda for a recurring bi-weekly check-in meeting with a client. These meetings maintain regular cadence and alignment throughout an engagement. The agenda should be structured, reference past meetings, and include both standing items and ad-hoc topics.

Agendas should be sent at least 24 hours before the meeting to give participants time to prepare.

## Purpose
- Maintain regular touchpoint and momentum
- Review progress since last meeting
- Discuss key topics and make decisions
- Surface any issues or blockers
- Plan next steps

## Tools Available
Gather context from available sources:
- **Calendar**: Previous meeting notes, action items from last session
- **Google Drive**: Recent deliverables, working documents
- **Email/Slack**: Open questions, topics raised since last meeting
- **Project tracking**: Current sprint/milestone status

## Workflow

1. **Review last meeting**: Pull action items and key decisions from previous check-in
2. **Gather current topics**: What's happened since last meeting? What needs discussion?
3. **Build agenda**: Combine standing items with ad-hoc topics
4. **Add details**: Include specific questions or discussion prompts for each topic
5. **Attach materials**: Link to any docs that need pre-read (only if complex)

## Formatting

Subject line format:
**[Client Name] Check-In Agenda - [Date]**
Example: "Pioneer Sports Check-In Agenda - Nov 25"

Email structure:
```

**Parking Lot** _(optional - for topics that came up but don't fit this meeting)_

[Sign-off]
```

## Standing Agenda Items (Typical)
Most bi-weekly check-ins include some version of these recurring items:
1. **Progress Update** - What's been completed since last meeting
2. **Roadmap Review** - What's coming next, any timeline changes
3. **Discussion Topics** - Open questions, decisions needed
4. **Blockers & Risks** - Anything slowing progress
5. **Next Steps** - Action items and ownership

Adapt these based on the specific engagement and client preferences.

## Detail Level Guidelines

**High-level topics:**
- "Review automation roadmap"
- "Discuss team training approach"

**With specific discussion questions:**
- "Review automation roadmap"
  - Which workflows should we prioritize in Phase 2?
  - Do we have the right resources committed for implementation?
  
- "Discuss team training approach"
  - Should we do hands-on workshops or self-paced modules?
  - Who are the key champions we should train first?

**Mix both approaches**: Use high-level for straightforward updates, add specific questions for topics that need decisions or deeper discussion.

## When to Include Pre-Read

Include pre-read materials when:
- There's a complex technical document to review (architecture, detailed analysis)
- You need thoughtful feedback on a strategic recommendation
- The meeting will be more productive if people come prepared
- You're presenting options and want people to think through them first

Don't include pre-read for:
- Simple status updates
- Documents you'll walk through live in the meeting
- Routine progress reviews

## Tone Guidelines
- **Professional but collaborative** - this is a partnership
- **Organized and clear** - respect people's time with structure
- **Forward-looking** - focus on progress and what's ahead
- **Action-oriented** - every topic should lead somewhere

## Tips for Good Agendas

**DO:**
- Reference specific action items from last meeting and their status
- Include time estimates if certain topics need deep discussion
- Call out decisions that need to be made explicitly
- Use the parking lot for topics that are important but not urgent

**DON'T:**
- Create 20 agenda items - keep it focused (4-7 topics max for a 30-60 min meeting)
- Include vague topics like "general discussion"
- Forget to close with next steps
- Send the agenda day-of without warning

## Customization by Engagement Phase

**Early engagement (first few check-ins):**
- More time on alignment and context-setting
- Deeper dives on strategy and approach
- Building shared understanding

**Mid engagement (steady state):**
- Efficient progress updates
- Focus on execution topics
- Quick decision-making

**Late engagement (wrapping up):**
- Transition planning
- Knowledge transfer
- Final deliverables review

## Example Good vs. Bad Topics

**GOOD:**
"Automation Priority Discussion"
- Should we tackle the rebate workflow or LED retrofit process first?
- What's the appetite for running these in parallel?
- Dependencies: Rebate needs API access (2-week lead time), LED retrofit ready to go

**BAD:**
"Talk about automation stuff"

**GOOD:**
"Training Rollout Plan"
- Reviewed draft curriculum - feedback requested on modules 3-4
- Identify 3-5 power users for pilot cohort
- Lock in training dates for January

**BAD:**
"Discuss training"

## Notes
- Keep meetings efficient - if you can cover it async (via email), do that instead
- The agenda itself becomes a useful artifact - store them in a shared location for reference
- If the same topics keep appearing in the parking lot, they probably need their own dedicated meeting
