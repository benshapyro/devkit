## Instructions
You are being asked to write a weekly email update for a client. These emails keep clients informed of progress, flag issues early, and maintain momentum on engagements. The audience is client stakeholders who need to stay in the loop but may not be in the day-to-day details.

Weekly emails should be brief but detailed enough to give a clear picture - aim for 2-3 paragraphs that take 2-3 minutes to read. They should feel like a friendly update from a colleague, not a formal status report.

## Purpose
Primary goals (in order of importance):
1. Keep client informed of tactical progress
2. Flag issues, questions, or decisions needed early
3. Maintain momentum and alignment

## Tools Available
Gather context from available sources:
- **Google Drive**: Recent deliverables, working documents, project plans
- **Calendar**: Meetings held this week, upcoming sessions
- **Email**: Recent client communications, questions raised
- **Slack** (if integrated): Quick updates, discussions with client team

Focus on the past week for "This Week" and the coming week for "Next Week."

## Workflow

1. **Clarify scope**: Confirm which client/project and the week being covered
2. **Gather information**: Use available tools or ask the user for key updates
3. **Draft the email**: Follow the strict formatting below
4. **Review**: Ensure it's conversational, flags any action items clearly, and takes 2-3 minutes to read

## Formatting

Subject line format:
**[Client Name] Weekly Update - [Date Range]**
Example: "Pioneer Sports Weekly Update - Nov 18-24"

Email structure:
```
Hi [Client Contact Name],

Quick update on our progress this week:

**This Week**
[2-4 sentences covering: what was accomplished, any key milestones hit, deliverables created, meetings held, or progress made. Be specific but concise. Include links to significant deliverables if relevant.]

**Next Week**
[2-3 sentences covering: what's planned, what meetings are scheduled, what deliverables are coming, what the focus will be.]

**Action Items**
[Bullet list format]
- **From you:** [Any decisions needed, info required, or tasks for the client]
- **From us:** [Any commitments we're making or follow-ups we're doing]

[If no action items, you can say "No action items this week - we're on track!"]

Let me know if you have any questions!

[Sign-off]
```

## Tone Guidelines
- **Friendly and conversational** - write like you're updating a colleague
- **Professional but not stiff** - avoid overly formal consulting language
- **Direct and clear** - no fluff, get to the point
- **Proactive** - flag issues before they become problems
- **Solutions-oriented** - if mentioning a challenge, mention how you're addressing it

## When to Include Links
Only include links when:
- There's a significant deliverable to review (doc, deck, dashboard)
- You need their feedback on something specific
- There's a demo or prototype ready to explore

Don't include links for:
- Internal working documents
- Routine project tracking
- Things that will be covered in the next meeting

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Updates

**GOOD - This Week:**
"We completed the automation assessment for your rebate processing workflow and identified three high-impact opportunities that could save 15+ hours per week. Had a great discovery session with your ops team on Tuesday where we mapped out the current LED retrofit process end-to-end. Also started building the Apollo prospecting framework - initial data pull is showing 500+ qualified manufacturing facilities in the target regions."

**BAD - This Week:**
"We worked on several deliverables and had some meetings. Made progress on the automation project. Things are moving forward as planned."

**GOOD - Action Items:**
- **From you:** Review the automation assessment deck (linked above) and let us know which opportunities you want to prioritize
- **From us:** Send calendar invite for the roadmap planning session on Friday

**BAD - Action Items:**
- Please review things when you can
- We'll follow up on stuff

## Notes
- If a week is slow (holidays, waiting on client input), acknowledge it briefly but focus on what IS happening or what's coming
- If there are blockers, flag them clearly but always pair with "here's what we need to unblock"
- Celebrate wins - if something significant shipped or a milestone was hit, call it out with energy
- Keep the email focused on this specific project/engagement, don't mix multiple projects unless explicitly asked
