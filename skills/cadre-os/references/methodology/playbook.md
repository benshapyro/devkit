## What Is Discovery?

Discovery is the process of deeply understanding a client's current state before proposing solutions. It's the foundation of everything we do — skip it or do it poorly, and everything downstream suffers.

**Discovery answers:** What's really going on here, and what should we do about it?

### Why Discovery Matters

| Without Good Discovery | With Good Discovery |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Solutions address symptoms, not root causes | Solutions target the actual problem |
| Recommendations feel generic | Recommendations feel tailored |
| Stakeholders feel unheard | Stakeholders feel understood |
| Implementation hits unexpected blockers | Risks are anticipated |
| ROI is hard to prove | Baseline is established for measurement |

### The Discovery Mindset

- **Curious, not assumptive** — We don't know the answer yet; we're here to learn
- **Empathetic, not judgmental** — Their current state exists for reasons
- **Systematic, not scattered** — We cover all dimensions methodically
- **Evidence-based, not opinion-based** — We capture quotes and data, not just impressions

## The Five Discovery Dimensions

Everything we learn in discovery maps to one of five dimensions:

### Dimension Details

| Dimension | What We Learn | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **People** | Who matters, what they want, how they feel about change | Who makes decisions? Who does the work? Who's affected? Who's supportive/resistant? |
| **Process** | How work actually happens (not just how it's supposed to) | What's the workflow? How long does it take? Where are the bottlenecks? What's manual? |
| **Technology** | What systems exist, how they connect, how well they work | What tools do you use? Do they talk to each other? What's missing? What do you hate? |
| **Challenges** | Pain points, inefficiencies, risks, unmet needs | What's frustrating? What takes too long? What breaks? What keeps you up at night? |
| **Solutions** | Ideas, wishes, past attempts, constraints | What have you tried? What would ideal look like? What's off the table? |

## Discovery Anti-Patterns

### Things That Derail Discovery

| Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | How to Avoid |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Solutioneering** | Jumping to recommendations before understanding | Discipline: no solutions until Phase 3 |
| **Executive Echo** | Only hearing leadership perspective | Insist on frontline interviews |
| **Happy Path Only** | Missing edge cases and exceptions | Ask: "What happens when...?" |
| **Tech Fixation** | Assuming technology is always the answer | Explore process and people dimensions equally |
| **Surface Skating** | Accepting first answers without probing | Use "5 Whys" technique |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Finding evidence for pre-existing beliefs | Actively seek disconfirming data |
| **Scope Creep** | Discovery expands indefinitely | Define boundaries upfront, timebox sessions |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Gathering data without synthesizing | Synthesize after each session, not just at end |

### Recovery Tactics

| If You Notice... | Do This... |
|------------------|------------|
| Only talked to managers | Request frontline interviews |
| Haven't seen systems in action | Schedule system demos |
| Lots of symptoms, no root causes | Run 5 Whys on top challenges |
| Conflicting information | Bring stakeholders together for alignment |
| Can't quantify impact | Ask for volume, frequency, time estimates |
| Missing a dimension entirely | Add targeted session to fill gap |

## Integration with Client Brain

Discovery feeds the Client Brain:

| Discovery Output | Brain Section Updated |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Key stakeholder insights | Stakeholder Map |
| Relationship signals | Relationship Health |
| Decisions made | Key Decisions Log |
| Client preferences learned | What Works / Doesn't |
| Engagement context | Active Schedule |

The Brain provides continuity; the Discovery Catalog provides depth.
