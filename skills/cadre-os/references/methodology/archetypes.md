## Why Archetypes Matter

Every client organization has different people, but certain patterns repeat. Recognizing archetypes helps you:
- Anticipate concerns before they surface
- Tailor your approach to what resonates
- Avoid common missteps
- Convert skeptics into supporters

**Important:** Real people are complex. Use archetypes as starting hypotheses, not fixed labels.

## The Power/Sentiment Matrix

Plot stakeholders on two dimensions:

```
                    SENTIMENT
           Resistant ◄────────► Supportive
              1                    10
              │
        10    │  ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
              │  │             │             │
     HIGH     │  │   THREAT    │  CHAMPION   │
              │  │  Powerful   │  Powerful   │
              │  │  Resistant  │  Supportive │
              │  │             │             │
   P    5     │  ├─────────────┼─────────────┤

   E    │     │  │  Less power │  Less power │
   R    │     │  │  Resistant  │  Supportive │
              │  │             │             │
