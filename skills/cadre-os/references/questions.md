## How to Use This Library

### Multi-Tag System

Questions are tagged with multiple attributes. Use any combination to find the right questions:

| Tag Type | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Dimension** | People, Process, Technology, Challenges, Solutions |
| **Role** | Executive, Manager, Practitioner, Technical |
| **Department** | Sales, Operations, Finance, IT, HR, Marketing, CS |
| **Layer** | Landscape, Problems, Process, Specifics |

### Selection Logic

1. **Check Brain + Catalog** for existing coverage
2. **Identify gaps** by dimension
3. **Filter by attendee's role** and department
4. **Prioritize under-covered** dimensions
5. **Skip questions** already answered in Catalog
6. **Add inline follow-ups** for key questions

> **Advanced techniques:** See [prep.md#follow-up-patterns](prep.md#follow-up-patterns) for energy-based follow-ups, 5 Whys, mirroring, and other deepening techniques.

### Question Scaling

| Duration | Total | Landscape | Problems | Process | Specifics |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 30 min | 6-8 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 45 min | 10-12 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 60 min | 12-15 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 2 |
| 90 min | 15-18 | 4 | 6 | 5 | 3 |

### Question Sequencing

Always follow: **Landscape → Problems → Process → Specifics**

Never start with specifics. Build context first.

### Follow-Up Format

```
Q: [Main question]
→ If [trigger]: [follow-up]
