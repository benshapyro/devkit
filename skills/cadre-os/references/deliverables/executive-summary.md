## Generation Process

### Step 1: Gather Content

```
1. Run synthesis → Get:
   - Top 5-7 insights
   - Primary patterns
   - Prioritized recommendations
   - Confidence levels

2. Query data access → Get:
   - Client name, industry
   - Engagement scope
   - Session count, stakeholder count
   - Business driver for engagement
```

### Step 2: Filter and Prioritize

```
1. Select top 4-5 findings (high confidence only)
2. Choose 1 primary insight (most important "so what")
3. Pick 3-4 recommendations:
   - 1 quick win (immediate)
   - 1-2 foundation items (near-term)
   - 1 strategic item (if appropriate)
4. Define 3 specific next steps
```

### Step 3: Draft Content

```
1. Write headlines first (complete thoughts)
2. Add one sentence context per finding
3. Write primary insight paragraph (make it quotable)
4. Add outcomes to each recommendation
5. Make next steps specific (owner, date)
```

### Step 4: Quality Check

Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] Fits on 1 page (2 max)
- [ ] Can be understood in 3 minutes
- [ ] Headlines tell the story on their own

## Complete Example

```markdown
# Contemporary Energy Solutions
## AI Strategy Assessment — Executive Brief

**Prepared by:** Cadre AI  
**Date:** November 28, 2025  
**Engagement:** Discovery Phase

---

## Context

Contemporary Energy Solutions engaged Cadre AI to assess AI automation 
opportunities across operations. Over three weeks, we conducted 8 discovery 
sessions with 12 stakeholders spanning Operations, IT, Finance, and Executive 
leadership.

**Business Driver:** Reduce operational overhead and improve decision-making 
speed to support 40% growth targets.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Manual data handling consumes 20+ hours weekly** — Four core systems 
   (ERP, CRM, field ops, analytics) operate in silos, requiring manual 
   data transfer at every handoff.

2. **Past technology initiative failure drives skepticism** — Technical staff 
   remain cautious due to a 2023 integration project that underdelivered, 
   creating adoption risk for new initiatives.

3. **Executive sponsorship is strong and aligned** — CEO and COO actively 
   champion AI adoption with clear understanding of investment required.

4. **Quick wins exist in reporting and scheduling** — Automated reporting 
   and dispatch optimization require minimal integration and deliver 
   measurable ROI within 30 days.

5. **Field technician workflow is prime automation target** — Dispatching, 
   routing, and job documentation represent highest-impact opportunity 
   for AI-powered optimization.

---

## The Opportunity

CES has a clear path to significant operational efficiency gains through 
targeted AI automation. The combination of strong executive support, 
identifiable quick wins, and high-impact automation opportunities creates 
favorable conditions for success. However, past initiative failures mean 
early wins are essential to build organizational confidence before tackling 
larger integration projects.

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate (Next 30 days):**
- Deploy automated daily reporting dashboard — Delivers real-time visibility, 
  saves 8+ hours/week, builds credibility with skeptical technical staff

**Near-term (60-90 days):**
- Implement AI-powered dispatch optimization — Reduces scheduling time by 
  40%, improves technician utilization
- Begin ERP-CRM integration planning — Foundation for eliminating manual 
  data transfer

**Strategic (6+ months):**
- Full system integration with AI orchestration — Eliminates data silos, 
  enables predictive operations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Approve Phase 1 quick wins scope** — Owner: Sarah Chen, By: Dec 6
2. **Identify IT resource for reporting build** — Owner: Marcus Webb, By: Dec 10
3. **Schedule steering committee kickoff** — Owner: Cadre, By: Dec 13

**Decision Needed:** Confirm budget allocation for Phase 1 ($XX,XXX range) 
to begin implementation in December.
