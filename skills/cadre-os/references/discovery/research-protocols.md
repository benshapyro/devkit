# Research Protocols

External research strategies for Deep Prep mode. Execute sequentially with stop gates — only proceed if gaps remain significant.

> **Scope:** This covers external research (Slack, Gmail, Fireflies, Web). Internal research (Brain, Catalog, project files) is covered in `prep.md`.

---

## Research Sequence

| Phase | Source | Permission | Time Limit |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Internal (Brain, Catalog, files) | Just do it | 2-3 min |
| 2 | Communications (Slack, Gmail, Fireflies) | Ask once, bundled | 5 min total |
| 3 | Web (LinkedIn, company site, news) | Ask once | 5-10 min |

**Stop Gate Rule:** After each phase, assess: "Do we have enough for a valuable brief?" If yes, stop. If critical gaps remain, request permission for next phase.

## Phase 2: Communications Search

### Permission Request

```
"I have basic context from Brain/Catalog but limited recent communication history.

Should I search communications (~5 min) to gather:
- Recent Slack threads with [client/contacts]
- Email exchanges with key stakeholders
- Previous meeting transcripts

This helps understand current state and relationship dynamics."
```

### Slack Search Protocol

**Time Limit:** 2 minutes

**Search Patterns:**
- `[Company name]` — Recent mentions
- `[Contact name]` — Specific person discussions
- `[Project name]` — Project-specific context
- `from:@[teammate] [client]` — Colleague conversations about client

**Extract:**
- Recent developments or updates
- Open questions or concerns
- Action items pending
- Relationship dynamics
- Tone and communication style

**Red Flags to Surface:**
- Unresolved complaints
- Delayed deliverables
- Scope concerns
- Relationship friction

### Gmail Search Protocol

**Time Limit:** 2 minutes

**Search Patterns:**
- `from:[client domain]` — Inbound emails
- `to:[client domain]` — Outbound emails
- `[client name] subject:[topic]` — Topic-specific threads
- `[contact name]` — Person-specific exchanges

**Extract:**
- Formal communications and commitments
- Decision trails
- Scheduling patterns (response times, preferences)
- Stakeholder cc patterns (who's looped in)
- Tone indicators

**Look For:**
- Recent email threads (last 30 days priority)
- Key decisions documented
- Outstanding asks
- Meeting follow-ups

---

### Fireflies Search Protocol

**Time Limit:** 2-3 minutes

**Search Patterns:**
- `[Company name]` — All client meetings
- `[Contact name]` — Meetings with specific person
- Filter by date — Most recent first

**For Each Relevant Transcript, Extract:**
- Key topics discussed
- Decisions made
- Action items assigned
- Pain points mentioned
- Quotes worth referencing
- Sentiment and energy

**Compare Across Transcripts:**
- Pattern identification
- Topic progression
- Changes in tone or priority
- Questions answered vs. remaining

---

## Phase 3: Web Research

### Permission Request

```
"I have solid internal context but limited information about [company updates / contact backgrounds].

Should I conduct light web research (~5-10 min) to gather:
- Company recent developments and market position
- Contact professional backgrounds and interests

This helps tailor questions and build rapport."
```

## Documentation Format

Capture findings concisely:

```markdown
## Research Summary

### Company Context
- [Key fact 1]
- [Key fact 2]
- Recent: [news/development]

### Contact Profiles

**[Name 1]** — [Title]
- Background: [relevant experience]
- Rapport: [shared connection/interest]
- Style: [communication preference]

**[Name 2]** — [Title]
- Background: [relevant experience]
- Rapport: [shared connection/interest]
- Style: [communication preference]

### Communication Context
- Recent topics: [from Slack/Email/Fireflies]
- Open items: [pending questions/actions]
- Sentiment: [overall tone]

### Knowledge Gaps Remaining
- [ ] [Gap 1]
- [ ] [Gap 2]
```

## Time Management

### Strict Limits

| Activity | Max Time |
|----------|----------|
| Slack search | 2 min |
| Gmail search | 2 min |
| Fireflies review | 3 min |
| Company web research | 5 min |
| Contact research (per person) | 3 min |
| **Total external research** | **10 min max** |

### Stop Conditions

Stop research when:
- You have 80%+ of needed context
- Time limit reached
- Diminishing returns (searches repeat same info)
- Enough for strong question selection

### Quality Over Completeness

Better to have solid prep on key topics than shallow coverage of everything. Prioritize:
1. Attendee backgrounds (for rapport)
2. Recent developments (for relevance)
3. Known pain points (for question targeting)
4. Relationship context (for tone calibration)
