# Follow-Up Question Patterns

Advanced techniques for deepening discovery conversations. Use these patterns when responses warrant deeper exploration.

> **Note:** Common topic-based follow-ups are embedded inline in `question-library.md`. This reference covers advanced techniques and energy-based patterns.

## Energy-Based Follow-Ups

Respond to emotional signals with appropriate deepening questions.

### Frustration Signals

**Detect when they:**
- Use words like "nightmare," "disaster," "terrible," "hate"
- Voice pitch changes or speaking speed increases
- Sigh or express exasperation
- Use extreme language

**Follow-Up Patterns:**
- "You mentioned [X] is a 'nightmare' — tell me more about what makes it so challenging"
- "Walk me through the last time [X] happened — what was that experience like?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one aspect of [X], what would it be?"
- "What impact does [X] have on you personally? On your team?"

**Example:**
> "The approval process is a complete nightmare"
> → "Walk me through the last approval you needed. What made it so difficult?"

---

### Pride/Excitement Signals

**Detect when they:**
- Use words like "love," "excited," "proud," "great"
- Speak faster or with more energy
- Volunteer more detail than asked

**Follow-Up Patterns:**
- "What made [X] successful?"
- "How did you overcome the challenges in getting [X] implemented?"
- "Could this approach work for [other problem area]?"

**Example:**
> "We're really proud of how our onboarding works now"
> → "What specifically makes it work so well? What did you change?"

---

### Hesitation/Uncertainty Signals

**Detect when they:**
- Pause before answering
- Use qualifiers like "I think," "maybe," "probably"
- Give vague or incomplete answers
- Change topics quickly

**Follow-Up Patterns:**
- "I noticed you paused there — is there complexity I should understand?"
- "What makes [X] tricky to explain?"
- "What would you need to know to answer that more definitively?"

**Example:**
> "Well... I think the problem is maybe with the system, but I'm not totally sure"
> → "I hear some uncertainty — what makes this hard to pin down?"

---

### Defensive Signals

**Detect when they:**
- Justify decisions or processes
- Deflect to others or external factors
- Minimize problems
- Become formal or withdrawn

**Follow-Up Patterns:**
- "I appreciate that context — help me understand what constraints you were working within"
- "If you were starting fresh today, what would you do differently?"
- "No criticism intended — I'm trying to understand how things evolved"

**Example:**
> "We had to do it that way because leadership wanted it fast"
> → "Totally understand the pressure — if you'd had more time, what would you have done differently?"

## Advanced Techniques

### The 5 Whys

Dig to root cause by asking "why" repeatedly (but gently):

```
Problem: "Reports are always late"
→ Why? "We have to manually compile data"
→ Why? "The systems don't talk to each other"
→ Why? "We bought them at different times without integration in mind"
→ Why? "There was no enterprise architecture function"
→ Root cause: Lack of integration strategy (not "reports are late")
```

**Softening Language:**
- "What do you think causes that?"
- "What leads to that?"
- "What's behind that?"

---

### Mirroring

Repeat the last few words as a question. Creates space for elaboration.

```
Them: "It's really frustrating when the system crashes."
You: "When it crashes...?"
Them: "Yeah, it happens maybe twice a week, usually during month-end..."
```

**Key:** Use rising intonation. Let silence do the work.

---

### Strategic Silence

After they answer, wait 3-5 seconds. They'll often add the most important part.

**When to use:**
- After they give a short answer
- When you sense they're holding back
- After emotionally charged statements

**What happens:** Discomfort fills silence. They elaborate, often with the real issue.

---

### Labeling

Name the emotion you're sensing. Validates their experience and invites elaboration.

**Patterns:**
- "It sounds like that's really frustrating."
- "It seems like there's some concern about timeline."
- "I'm sensing some hesitation about that approach."

**Key:** Start with "It sounds like..." or "It seems like..." — less confrontational than "You're frustrated."

---

### Calibrated Questions

Start with "What" or "How" instead of "Why" (less defensive):

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "Why did that fail?" | "What do you think contributed to that outcome?" |
| "Why do you do it that way?" | "How did you arrive at this approach?" |
| "Why is that a problem?" | "What makes this challenging?" |

---

## Quantification Patterns

When they use vague language, push for specifics:

| Vague Statement | Quantification Follow-Up |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| "It takes too long" | "How long exactly? What's the fastest it's been?" |
| "There are too many errors" | "What's the error rate? How many per week?" |
| "It's inefficient" | "How many steps? How many people touch it?" |
| "It costs too much" | "What's the dollar amount? Per instance or per year?" |
| "It happens all the time" | "How often specifically? Daily? Weekly?" |
| "Lots of people are affected" | "How many exactly? Which teams?" |

---

## Topic Trigger Quick Reference

When they mention... dig into:

| Topic Mentioned | Quantify | Process | Impact |
|-----------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Approvals | How many steps? How long? | Who's involved? | What gets delayed? |
| Data | How many systems? | How does it flow? | What decisions suffer? |
| Time | Hours per week? | Where does it go? | What gets dropped? |
| Manual process | Volume? Error rate? | Walk through steps | What if person is out? |
| System/tool | User adoption? | How integrated? | What workarounds exist? |
| Communication | How often breaks down? | Between whom? | What's the cost? |
| Training | How long to proficiency? | What's the method? | What's retention? |
| Integration | API? File? Manual? | Who maintains? | What breaks? |

## Pattern Application Rules

### When to Use Advanced Techniques

| Situation | Technique |
|-----------|-----------|
| Surface-level answer | 5 Whys |
| Short answer, seems like more | Mirroring or Silence |
| Emotional statement | Labeling |
| Defensive response | Calibrated Questions |
| Vague claim | Quantification |

### When to Move On

- You've asked 2-3 follow-ups on the same topic
- They're repeating themselves
- Body language shows discomfort
- Time is limited and other gaps exist
- You have enough to inform strategy

### Pacing

- Don't machine-gun follow-ups
- Let one follow-up land before asking another
- Mix techniques — don't overuse any single approach
- Watch the clock — deep dives eat time
