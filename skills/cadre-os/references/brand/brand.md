## Who We Are

**One-liner:** Cadre AI turns AI ambition into operational reality for mid-market companies who can't afford to get it wrong.

**Tagline:** "Less AI hype. More execution. Real EBITDA."

**Three modes of work:**

| Mode | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Discovery | Find highest-impact AI opportunities, size the prize, build roadmap | 4-8 weeks |
| Build | Design and implement AI systems—agents, automations, integrations | 8-16 weeks |
| Enable | Train teams, transfer knowledge, build internal capability | 4-12 weeks |

## Who We Serve

### Primary: The Accountable Executive

COO, CFO, CTO, or VP of Operations at mid-market company. Their neck is on the line for AI outcomes.

**What's true about them:**
- Asked/told to "figure out AI" by board or CEO
- Skeptical of hype—seen tech initiatives fail before
- Don't have deep AI expertise themselves
- Measured on business outcomes, not innovation theater
- Have budget but limited internal resources
- Worried about falling behind competitors

**Their inner monologue:**
> "I know we need to do something with AI, but I don't know where to start, and I can't afford to blow $500K on a consulting engagement that produces a deck we never use."

**How they evaluate partners:**
- Credibility: Have you done this before?
- Pragmatism: Will you tell me the truth?
- Speed to value: How fast will I see results?
- Risk: What's the downside if this doesn't work?

### Secondary: The Internal Champion

Director or Senior Manager tapped to lead the AI initiative. Reports to Accountable Executive.

**Different from executive:**
- More hands-on in day-to-day
- More technically curious
- Career may depend on initiative succeeding
- Needs air cover from credible partner

**What they need:**
- Partnership, not condescension
- Tools/frameworks they can use independently
- Help navigating internal politics
- Visible wins they can point to

### Who We Don't Serve

- Enterprise giants (>$5B) — Have internal teams, McKinsey relationships
- Startups (<$20M) — Can't afford us; should be building, not buying
- Staff augmentation seekers — We're not body shop contractors
- Innovation theater clients — If they want to look like they're doing AI without changing anything, we're not interested

## Our Point of View

### On AI Adoption

**Most companies do it backwards.** They start with technology ("Let's use GPT-4!") instead of the problem ("What's costing us money?"). They run pilots to prove AI works instead of to prove business value.

**Our approach:**
1. Start with pain, not possibility
2. Prove value in weeks, not quarters
3. Build for adoption, not just functionality
4. Measure what matters to the business

### On Consulting

**Strategy without execution is expensive entertainment.** We've all seen the $2M engagement that produces a 200-page deck sitting in SharePoint forever.

**Our approach:**
- Every engagement includes hands-on building
- We don't recommend things we can't implement
- Success = outcomes, not deliverables
- Fewer things done well > many things done poorly

### On Client Relationships

**The goal is to make ourselves unnecessary.** A consultant who creates dependency is a parasite. Our job is to transfer capability, not hoard it.

**Our approach:**
- Teach while we build
- Document everything
- Build internal champions
- Define clear exit criteria

## Competitive Position

### Landscape

| Type | Examples | Their Approach | Our Difference |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Big 4/MBB | McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte | Massive teams, enterprise, strategy-heavy | We build; right-sized for mid-market |
| Tech Consultancies | Slalom, Thoughtworks | Engineering-first | We lead with business impact |
| AI Boutiques | Small specialty firms | Narrow focus (just NLP, etc.) | Broader and more strategic |
| Platform Vendors | MSFT/Google/AWS partners | Tied to platforms | Platform-agnostic |
| Freelancers | Independent consultants | Variable quality, limited scale | Depth and breadth |

### Where We Win

We own the space between strategy and implementation for mid-market:
- Too big for freelancers, too small for McKinsey
- Need more than a deck, don't want 50-person team
- Want business outcomes, not technology demos
- Value speed and pragmatism

### Unfair Advantages

1. OpenAI Service Partner status (credibility, access)
2. Pod-based delivery (consistent teams)
3. Mid-market focus (understand constraints)
4. Builder DNA (came from operating roles)

## Brand Personality

Four traits that should describe how we actually show up:

### 1. Direct

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "This use case won't generate ROI. Here's why." | "There are some considerations that might impact potential value realization." |
| Lead with conclusion, then explain | Build up context before the point |
| Name problems explicitly | Hint at issues without stating them |
| Give recommendations | Present options without guidance |

### 2. Rigorous

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Show the math | "Trust us, this is right" |
| Cite sources and evidence | Make unsupported claims |
| Acknowledge uncertainty ranges | False precision |
| Admit when we don't know | Bullshit our way through |

### 3. Warm

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Remember personal details | Treat people as "accounts" |
| Acknowledge difficulty of change | "Just get buy-in" |
| Celebrate wins together | Take all credit |
| Be genuinely interested | Go through motions |

### 4. Confident

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Make clear recommendations | "It depends..." without follow-through |
| Take positions | Default to "best practices" |
| Own our expertise | Excessive self-deprecation |
| Push back when clients are wrong | Be a yes-shop |

### The Balance

**Direct + Warm:** Honest *and* kind—not honest *instead of* kind.

**Confident + Rigorous:** Assert positions *because* we've done the work—not *instead of* doing the work.

**The goal:** Feel like the smartest person in the room who's also the most helpful. Not the smartest person who makes everyone else feel stupid.

## Messaging Hierarchy

Use appropriate level based on context:

**Level 1 - Tagline** (5-7 words, brand recognition)
> "Less AI hype. More execution. Real EBITDA."

**Level 2 - Value Proposition** (1-2 sentences, what we do)
> "We turn AI from a buzzword into a bottom-line growth engine—with strategy, systems, and tools that deliver measurable impact."

**Level 3 - Proof Points** (specific claims, use 1-2 per context)
- Official OpenAI Service Partner (fewer than 50 globally)
- 90-day average time to first production deployment
- 30-person firm, 7 active clients (attention and focus)
- 100% mid-market focus ($50M-$2B revenue)

**Level 4 - Audience-Specific**

*For executives (COO/CFO/CTO):*
> Your board wants AI progress. Your team is overwhelmed. We find the 2-3 places AI will actually move your numbers, then build them. Usually something in production within 90 days.

*For internal champions (Director/Sr. Manager):*
> You've been handed the AI initiative. We'll work alongside you, build with your team (not just for them), and make sure you have the skills to keep going after we're done.

## Website Copy

### Hero Sections

**Structure:**
```
Headline (outcome, <10 words)
Subheadline (how, 1-2 sentences)
Single CTA
```

**Examples:**

✓ Good:
```
Close your books in days, not weeks.
AI-powered reconciliation that works with your ERP, your data, and your team.
[See how it works →]
```

❌ Bad:
```
Unlock Your Business Potential with Cutting-Edge AI-Powered Digital Transformation Solutions
[Learn more]
```

### Service Descriptions

**Structure:**
```
The problem: [Pain point in their words]
What we do: [Specific activities, timeline]
What you get: [Concrete deliverables]
Investment: [Price range]

## Proposals

### Executive Summary (1 page max)

**Structure:** Situation → Recommendation → Outcome → Investment

### Scope Sections

- Extremely specific about what's included
- Equally specific about what's NOT included
- Clear deliverable names
- No ambiguity

### Pricing

- Simple structure, not clever
- Explain the "why" behind structure
- Make value exchange obvious

## Emails

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Specific, curiosity-driving, not clickbait]

Middle: One specific insight or observation
CTA: Single, low-commitment next step
```

**Avoid:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Partnership opportunity" subject lines
- 30-minute call asks (too big for cold outreach)
- Emoji in subject lines

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Week X update: specific milestone]

Next week: [bullet list]
Need from you: [clear ask if any]

```
