## Section 2: Key Personas (10 minutes) - MOST CRITICAL

### 3. Primary Users
**Question**: "Who are the 3-4 people who will use this most? For each person, tell me:"
- Full name and role
- What tasks do they spend the most time on?
- What's their biggest pain point or frustration?
- Technical sophistication (1-5: beginner to expert)

**Example answer**:
```
Katie Hacker - Proposal Manager
- Tasks: Writing proposals, vendor forms, project descriptions
- Pain: Proposals take 21 days, lots of back-and-forth with sales
- Tech level: 3/5 (comfortable with tools, not a power user)

Ryan Rahmlow - Operations Director  
- Tasks: Process documentation, team training, system optimization
- Pain: Everyone does things differently, no standardization
- Tech level: 5/5 (internal AI champion, very technical)
```

**Why it matters**: Real names and specific pain points = higher relevance = better adoption. This is the #1 factor in coach success.

---

### 4. Persona Distribution
**Question**: "What's the technical sophistication of the team overall?"
- [ ] Mostly beginners (never used AI before)
- [ ] Mixed (some comfortable, some not)
- [ ] Mostly intermediate (use ChatGPT occasionally)
- [ ] Advanced (power users, already creating GPTs)

**Why it matters**: Determines language complexity and explanation depth.

---

## Section 3: Common Tasks (7 minutes)

### 5. Frequent Use Cases
**Question**: "What are the 5-7 tasks they do most often that ChatGPT could help with?"

**Prompts to help them answer**:
- "What takes up most of their time?"
- "What do they create/write/analyze regularly?"
- "What's repetitive or formulaic?"

**Good examples**:
- Writing proposals and RFP responses
- Creating meeting summaries and action items
- Drafting client emails and communications
- Analyzing data and creating reports
- Generating project documentation
- Research and competitive analysis
- Creating marketing/sales content

**Why it matters**: These become the concrete examples in instructions and user guide.

---

### 6. Priority Tasks
**Question**: "Of those tasks, which 2-3 are most important or most painful?"

**Why it matters**: Focus examples and use cases on highest-impact areas first.

---

## Section 4: Culture & Values (5 minutes)

### 7. Communication Style
**Question**: "How do they communicate internally? Pick the closest match:"

**Options**:
- **Professional & Formal**: Finance, legal, healthcare (suits and structure)
- **Professional & Practical**: Manufacturing, construction (get it done right)
- **Friendly & Collaborative**: Tech startups, agencies (team-first culture)
- **Direct & Efficient**: Sales, ops-focused (no fluff, just results)
- **Casual & Creative**: Marketing, design (personality encouraged)

**Why it matters**: Coach tone must match culture or it feels foreign.

---

### 8. Top Priorities
**Question**: "What do they value most in their work? (Pick top 2)"
- [ ] Speed (fast turnaround, quick decisions)
- [ ] Quality (precision, perfection, thorough)
- [ ] Simplicity (easy to use, not complicated)
- [ ] Innovation (cutting-edge, creative solutions)
- [ ] Reliability (consistency, proven methods)
- [ ] Compliance (accuracy, by-the-book)

---

## Section 5: Pain Points (5 minutes)

### 9. Specific Problems
**Question**: "What are 3-5 specific issues they're trying to solve? Be concrete."

**Good examples**:
- "Katie spends 4-6 hours per proposal, needs to cut to 90 minutes"
- "Sales team writes 50+ custom emails/day, quality is inconsistent"
- "Operations has no standardized procedures, everyone does it differently"
- "Analysts spend 3 hours/week on repetitive status reports"

**Bad examples**:
- "They want to be more efficient" (too vague)
- "They need better AI" (not specific enough)
- "Improve productivity" (not measurable)

**Why it matters**: Specific pain points with names make use cases feel real and relevant.

---

### 10. Past AI Experience
**Question**: "Have they used AI tools before? What worked or didn't work?"

**Why it matters**: 
- If failed before → Address concerns in user guide
- If succeeded before → Build on that momentum
- If never tried → Set realistic expectations

## Red Flags

Watch for these answers that need follow-up:

| Red Flag | Problem | What to Ask |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| "We do AI stuff" | Too vague | "What specifically? Proposals, emails, analysis?" |
| "Everyone will use it" | No personas | "Who are the 3 people most likely to try it first?" |
| "They're not technical" | Unclear level | "Do they use ChatGPT now? Email? Excel?" |
| "Make it generic" | Missing the point | "Generic = low adoption. What makes them unique?" |
| No pain points mentioned | Won't show value | "What takes too long or frustrates them most?" |

## Validation Questions

Before generating, confirm:

If you answered NO to more than 2, ask more questions.
