                 │   HUB CONTENT   │
                 │ (Blog post/Video)│
                 └────────┬────────┘
                          │
      ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐

```

### Workflow

1. **Create hub content** (blog post, video, podcast)
2. **Adapt for each channel** (don't just copy)
3. **Publish across channels** (staggered or same day)
4. **Link back to hub** (drive traffic to owned media)
5. **Engage with responses** (build community)
6. **Repurpose later** (evergreen content recycling)
