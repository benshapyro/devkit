## Common Mistakes

### 1. Over-Planning, Under-Executing
**Problem:** Detailed 12-month calendar that's obsolete by month 2
**Solution:** Plan quarterly themes, detail monthly, adjust weekly

### 2. Ignoring Search Intent
**Problem:** Content topics picked without keyword research
**Solution:** Every pillar/cluster should start with SEO data

### 3. No Content Briefs
**Problem:** Writers guess at requirements, inconsistent quality
**Solution:** Brief every piece before production starts

### 4. Channel-Agnostic Creation
**Problem:** Same content copy-pasted everywhere
**Solution:** Adapt messaging per platform (see multi-channel reference)

### 5. Skipping Performance Review
**Problem:** No learning, repeated mistakes
**Solution:** Monthly analysis with documented adjustments

### 6. Unrealistic Volume
**Problem:** Planning 20 posts/month with capacity for 8
**Solution:** Audit actual capacity, plan 80% of it

### 7. No Content Repurposing
**Problem:** Every piece created from scratch
**Solution:** Plan repurposing as part of initial brief
